\begin{abstract}
We generalize the technique of fringe-rate filtering for radio interferometry, where visibilities 
are Fourier transformed in time into fringe-rate space and low-pass filtered. Different fringe rates
are sourced by emission from different parts of the sky, and we capitalize on this geometric
interpretation to show how fringe-rate filters can be optimized for various applications.
These
include mapmaking, the minimization of polarization leakage, minimizing instrumental systematics,
and power spectrum estimation. We show that fringe-rate filtering arises naturally in minimum variance
treatments of many of these problems, enabling optimal visibility-based approaches to analyses of
interferometric data that avoid systematics that may be induced by traditional approaches such as imaging. Our techniques have
recently been demonstrated in \citet{ali_et_al2015}, where new upper limits
were placed on the $21\,\textrm{cm}$ power spectrum from reionization, showcasing the ability
of fringe-rate filtering to successfully boost sensitivity and reduce the impact of systematics in
deep observations.

\section{Introduction}

In recent years, low-frequency radio interferometers have gone through dramatic changes in design.
These transformations have been driven by new science applications such as $21\,\textrm{cm}$
cosmology, where one uses the highly redshifted $21\,\textrm{cm}$ hyperfine transition
of neutral hydrogen to map our early Universe. Observers in $21\,\textrm{cm}$ cosmology seek to
measure small fluctuations (both spatially and spectrally) on top of a dim, diffuse background that itself is obscured by bright
foreground sources that are orders of magnitude brighter in brightness temperature. This stands
in contrast to many traditional observations in radio astronomy, which more usually target bright,
compact objects in front of a dim background, often over a small selection of frequencies. These differences have led to the design, construction, 
and usage of new interferometers that only have moderate angular resolution, but are comprised of a
large number of receiving elements with wide fields of view operating over a wide bandwidth. Examples of new interferometers that at least roughly fit this description include the Donald C. Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER; \citealt{parsons_et_al2010}), the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA; \citealt{tingay_et_al2013,bowman_et_al2012}), the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR; \citealt{van_haarlem_et_al2013}), the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME; \citealt{bandura_et_al2014}), the MIT Epoch of Reionization experiment (MITEoR; \citealt{zheng_et_al2014}), the Large Aperture Experiment to Detect the 
Dark Ages (LEDA; \citealt{greenhill_et_al2012}), and the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization
Array (HERA; \citealt{pober_et_al2014}). Further deviating from conventional array
designs, the PAPER, MITEoR, CHIME, HERA projects have also maximized sensitivity by choosing to place their antenna elements in regular, redundant grids \citep{parsons_et_al2012a}.

With new telescope designs, it is natural to expect new approaches to data analysis. In this paper,
we critically examine methods for time integration. Integrating in time is a crucial step for the
high-sensitivity applications of modern low-frequency radio astronomy. Consider the measurement of
the high-redshift $21\,\textrm{cm}$ power spectrum as an example application. At the relevant redshifts ($z\sim 6$ to $20$), theoretical models suggest that this cosmological signal will be faint, on the order of $1\,\textrm{mK}$ in brightness temperature. The noise power spectrum on such
measurements reaches comparable magnitudes only after long integration ($\gtrsim 1000\,\textrm{hrs}$)
on instruments optimized for such a measurement \citep{harker_et_al2010,parsons_et_al2012a,beardsley_et_al2013,pober_et_al2014}, and even then, often only for the largest spatial modes (depending on the instrument).
Long time-integrations are therefore crucial not only for generating the requisite sensitivity for a
detection of the cosmological signal, but also to allow faint systematics to be detected and excised
from the data.

In this paper, we extend ideas introduced in \citet{parsons_backer2009} to optimize the process of combining time-ordered data. The key realization is that fringe-rates---the Fourier dual to time---is a
more natural space to enact time-averaging. Traditional time-averaging (say, a running box-car average)
is equivalent to multiplying by a sinc filter in the fringe-rate domain. Generalizing this process, the
convolution theorem ensures that time integration can be achieved by low-pass filtering the data (i.e.,
weighting the data) in the fringe-rate domain. The fringe-rate domain provides a natural basis for time-averaging interferometeric
data because astronomical sources are locked to the celestial sphere, and therefore appear at
predictable fringe-rates in the data. In particular, for a given interferometric baseline, there exists
a maximum allowable fringe-rate, beyond which there is only instrumental noise. Fringe-rate filtering
allows the clean elimination of such noise-like modes.

We place a particular emphasis on the geometric interpretation of fringe-rate filtering,
where weightings in the fringe-rate domain result in changes to an interferometer's primary beam,
effectively allowing different portions of the sky to be selected by carefully chosen fringe-rate filters.
These filters can be optimized for a number of different applications, including the measurement
of cosmological power spectra, the reduction of polarization leakage, and the downweighting of
contaminating sources far from the central regions of the sky that one is attempting to observe.
Importantly, these filters can be implemented on a per-baseline basis, providing cleaner views
of systematics in the data, which are often easier to identify when described baseline-by-baseline,
instead of being mixed together in an image-domain map. However, we will also show that the
optimally weighted mapmaking can also be more conveniently conceptualized in a mathematical
framework operating in the fringe-rate basis.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:overview} we provide a general
overview of fringe-rate filtering, establishing some essential geometric intuition for the process. The
specific implementation that we use for the simulations in this paper are described in Section
\ref{sec:Implementation}. Section \ref{sec:bmsculpt} describes how fringe-rate filtering can be
optimized for various applications. We pay specific attention to the problem of mapmaking in
Section \ref{sec:Mapmaking}, and show that fringe-rate filtering arises naturally in that context as well.
We summarize our conclusions in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.


\section{Overview of principle of fringe-rate filtering}
\label{sec:overview}
Generally, the interferometric response $V$ at frequency $\nu$ for two antennas in a radio interferometer is described
by the visibility function\footnote{In this section, we omit the instrumental noise contribution to the measured visibilities in order to avoid notational clutter.}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:originalVis}
V_{b\nu}(t)=\int d\Omega \, {I_\nu(\rhat) A_\nu(\rhat,t) \exp \left[-i2\pi \frac{\nu}{c}  \mathbf{b}(t) \cdot \rhat\right]},
\end{equation}
where $I_\nu$ is the specific intensity of the sky in the direction $\rhat$,
$A_\nu$ is the geometric mean of the primary beam power patterns of the constituent antennas (henceforth known as ``the primary beam"), $\mathbf{ b}(t)$ is the baseline vector separating the two antennas in question (which is time-dependent since the baselines rotate with the Earth), and $\nu$ is the spectral
frequency.
%Interferometric responses (visibilities) for ground-based instruments are generally 
%a function of time, $t$, even for a static sky because the Earth's rotation makes the expression of $I$ 
%in topocentric coordinates a time-dependent quantity.
Here, we have adopted the convention that our coordinate system is fixed to the celestial sphere, because it will be convenient for our algebraic manipulations later. However, it is equally valid to understand the time-variation of the visibilities as arising from the movement of astronomical sources through the primary beam and the fringes arising from a baseline, which are fixed to a topocentric coordinate system. For drift-scan telescopes like PAPER, CHIME, or HERA, this view is particularly powerful because then the primary beam and the fringe pattern are locked to one another, and may together be considered an enveloped fringe pattern that gives rise
to time variation in $V_{b\nu}(t)$ as the Earth rotates.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=.9\columnwidth]{plots/ew_fringe}
\caption{
The fringe pattern at 150 MHz of a 30-m east-west baseline, overlaid with arrows indicating
the distance traversed by sources at various declinations over a two-hour time span centered at transit.
In a fixed time interval, sources near $\delta=0^\circ$ traverse more 
fringe periods than sources nearer to the celestial poles. This gives rise to different
fringe rates that can be used to distinguish sources in a timeseries measured with a single baseline.
}\label{fig:ew_fringe}
\end{figure}

The rate at which angular structure on the sky moves relative to the fringe pattern---the \emph{fringe rate}---depends on the declination and hour angle. 
%
%Assuming that antenna positions are fixed to the Earth, the fringe pattern of an interferometer ---
%the variation in phase response across the sky --- is fixed in topocentric coordinates.  Hence, time
%variation in $V_\nu(t)$ can be regarded as resulting from the motion of spatial structures in $I$ through
%the fringe pattern and primary beam response pattern.  Moreover, for interferometers such as PAPER, CHIME, and HERA 
%% XXX others? cite here or before?
%that do not point, but instead drift-scan the sky as it rotates by, the primary beam response pattern and the
%phase response pattern are locked to one another, and may together be considered the fringe pattern that gives rise
%to time variation in $V_\nu(t)$ as the Earth rotates.
%
%The rate at which angular structure in $I$ moves through a fringe pattern depends both on declination
%and hour angle.  
As an example, Figure \ref{fig:ew_fringe} illustrates the real component of the phase
variation in the fringe pattern of a 30-m east-west baseline deployed at $-30^\circ$ latitude.
Though fringes are evenly spaced in $l\equiv\sin\theta_x$, the distance a source that is locked to the celestial
sphere travels through the fringe pattern depends on its position on the sphere. This is illustrated in Figure
\ref{fig:ew_fringe} by arrows that indicate the motion of sources at differing declinations over the course
of two hours near transit.  The movement of a source through the fringe pattern causes $V_\nu(t)$ to oscillate
with an amplitude that is determined by the strength of the source and the amplitude of the beam response,
and a frequency that corresponds to the number of fringe periods traversed in a given time interval.  Hence, the frequency or {\it fringe-rate} of oscillations in $V_\nu(t)$
ranges from a maximum at $\delta=0^\circ$ to zero at $\delta=-90^\circ$, and can even become negative
for emission from the far side of the celestial pole.
% XXX is there a name for the far side of the celestial pole?

Let us now derive this intuition mathematically, assuming a drift-scan telescope. To sort our time-variable visibilities into different fringe-rates $f$, we take the Fourier transform of our visibility over a short interval of time centered at time $t$ to get
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:OriginalFR}
\overline{V}_{b\nu} (f,t) = \int d\Omega I_\nu(\rhat)\!\! \int dt^\prime \gamma (t^\prime - t) A_\nu(\rhat,t^\prime) e^{-i2 \pi \left [f (t^\prime - t) +\frac{ \nu}{c} \mathbf{b}_{t^\prime} \cdot \rhat  \right]},
\end{equation}
where we have introduced the notation $\mathbf{b}_t \equiv \mathbf{b}(t)$, and $\gamma$ is a tapering function for the Fourier transform in time, which we assume peaks when its argument is zero, thereby centering our transform at time $t^\prime = t$. If the characteristic width of $\gamma$ is relatively short, the time-dependence of the visibility will likely be dominated by features on the sky moving relative to fringes, and not the movement of the primary beam through the celestial sphere. We may therefore say that for short periods of time, $A_\nu (\rhat,t^\prime) \approx A_\nu (\rhat,t)$. Additionally, we may take the time-dependence of the baselines to leading order, with
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{b}_{t^\prime} &\approx& \mathbf{b}_{t} + \frac{d\mathbf{b}}{dt} \Bigg{|}_{t^\prime=t} (t^\prime -t) + \dots \nonumber \\
&=& \mathbf{b}_t+ (\boldsymbol \omega_\Earth \times \mathbf{b}_t) (t^\prime -t) + \dots
\end{eqnarray}
where $\boldsymbol \omega_\Earth$ is the angular velocity vector of the Earth's rotation. In the last equality, we used the fact that the time-dependence of the baselines are not arbitrary, but instead are tied to the Earth's rotation, transforming the time derivative into a cross-product with $\boldsymbol \omega_\Earth$, as one does in the analysis of solid rotating bodies. Inserting these approximations into Equation~\eqref{eq:OriginalFR} yields
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:nextFR}
\overline{V}_{b\nu} (f,t) =  \int &&d\Omega  I_\nu(\rhat) A_{\nu} (\rhat,t) e^{-i2 \pi \frac{ \nu}{c} \mathbf{b}_t \cdot \rhat }   \nonumber \\
&&\times\int dt^\prime \gamma (t^\prime -t)  e^{i2 \pi [ \frac{\nu}{c} (\mathbf{b}_t \times \boldsymbol \omega_\Earth) \cdot \rhat -f] (t^\prime -t)} \nonumber \\
=  \int d\Omega I_\nu(\rhat)  && \!\! A_{\nu} (\rhat,t)  e^{-i2 \pi \frac{ \nu}{c} \mathbf{b}_t \cdot \rhat } \,\widetilde{\gamma} \! \left[ \frac{\nu}{c} (\mathbf{b}_t \times \boldsymbol \omega_\Earth) \cdot \rhat -f \right], \qquad
\end{eqnarray}
where $\tilde{\gamma}$ is the Fourier transform of $\gamma$. To the extent that $\gamma(t)$ can be chosen to be relatively broad without violating our approximations, $\tilde{\gamma}$ will be peaked around the point where its argument is zero. Its presence in Equation \eqref{eq:nextFR} therefore acts approximately like a delta function, selecting portions of the sky that have $\rhat$ satisfying the condition $f \approx \rhat \cdot \mathbf{b} \times \boldsymbol \omega_\Earth \nu / c $.

In words, what the above derivation shows is that as advertised, different fringe-rates correspond to different parts of the sky. This is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:fringe_contours}, which shows contours of constant fringe-rate for the same baseline as the one simulated in Figure \ref{fig:ew_fringe}. Contours of constant fringe-rate correspond to locations on the sky $\rhat$ that have the same degenerate combination of $\rhat \cdot \mathbf{b}  \times \boldsymbol \omega_\Earth$. Note that this combination can also be rewritten as $\boldsymbol \omega_\Earth \cdot \rhat  \times \mathbf{b}$ or $\mathbf{b} \cdot  \boldsymbol \omega_\Earth \times \rhat $ by cyclic permutation. Thus, if any two of $\mathbf{b}$, $\boldsymbol \omega_\Earth$, and $\rhat$ are parallel, their cross product---and hence the fringe-rate---will be zero. For example, the fringe-rate for astronomical sources located at either celestial pole will always be zero, since $\rhat$ would then be parallel to $\boldsymbol \omega_\Earth$. Similarly, a north-south only baseline located at the equator would have $\mathbf{b}$ parallel to $\boldsymbol \omega_\Earth$, resulting in $f=0$ because in such a scenario the fringes would have no azimuthal dependence, and thus there would be no fringe-crossings as the Earth rotates relative to the sky.

Because different fringe-rates correspond to different parts of the sky, we may effectively select different portions of the sky by picking different linear combinations of fringe-rates. To see this, imagine decomposing our data into fringe-rates, and then applying a weighting function $w(f)$ before Fourier transforming back to the time domain. The result is
\begin{eqnarray}
&&V^\textrm{filt}_{b \nu}(t^\prime,t) = \int df w(f) \overline{V}_{b\nu} (f,t) e^{i 2\pi f (t^\prime-t)} \nonumber \\
&&=  \int d\Omega I_\nu(\rhat) A_{\nu} (\rhat,t) e^{-i2 \pi \frac{ \nu}{c} \mathbf{b}_t \cdot \rhat } \nonumber \\
&& \times \int df e^{i 2\pi f (t^\prime-t)} w(f)  \widetilde{\gamma} \! \left[ \frac{\nu}{c} (\mathbf{b}_t \times \boldsymbol \omega_\Earth) \cdot \rhat -f \right].\qquad
%&\equiv&  \int d\Omega I_\nu(\rhat) A^\textrm{eff}_{\nu,0} (\rhat) e^{i2 \pi \frac{ \nu}{c} \mathbf{b}_0 \cdot \rhat } ,
\end{eqnarray}
Now, suppose we implement this filter in a sliding manner in time. That is, we repeat this process with the fringe-rate transform centered on each instant in time. With this, we become interested in only $t^\prime = t$, so the final set of filtered visibilities takes the form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ShrunkBeam}
V^\textrm{filt}_{b\nu}(t) = \int d\Omega \, {I_\nu(\rhat) A^\textrm{eff}_{\nu} (\rhat, t)\exp \left[-i2\pi \frac{\nu}{c}  \mathbf{b}(t) \cdot \rhat\right]},
\end{equation}
which is precisely the same as our original measurement equation, except the primary beam has been replaced by an \emph{effective primary beam}, defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:EffectiveBeamDef}
A^\textrm{eff}_{\nu} (\rhat, t)\equiv A_{\nu} (\rhat, t) (w * \tilde{\gamma}) \left[ \frac{\nu}{c} (\mathbf{b}_t \times \boldsymbol \omega_\Earth) \cdot \rhat  \right],
\end{equation}
with * signifying a convolution. We thus see that by judiciously selecting fringe-rate weights, one can effectively reshape one's beam. In general, however, we cannot do so with perfect flexibility. This can be seen by once again examining the combination $\rhat \cdot \mathbf{b} \times  \boldsymbol \omega_\Earth$. For any given instant, $\mathbf{b} \times \boldsymbol \omega_\Earth$ picks out a particular direction on the celestial sphere. A ring of locations $\rhat$ on the sky at a constant angle with respect to this direction will have the same value of $\rhat \cdot  \mathbf{b} \times \boldsymbol \omega_\Earth$, and therefore the same fringe-rate. As a result, contours of constant fringe-rate always form rings on the sky, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:fringe_contours}. By weighting different fringe-rates, one can effectively ``turn off" (or less harshly, to simply downweight) whole contours, but never portions of a contour.

Aside from modifying the shape of one's beam, fringe-rate filtering can also be used to integrate visibilities in time. For example, if $w(f)$ is chosen in a way that suppresses high fringe rates, the effect in the time domain will be a low-pass filter that essentially averages together data. Enacting the time-averaging in the fringe-rate domain is particularly helpful for differentiating between noise- and signal-like modes in the time-series data. To see this, recall that the relative compactness of the $\tilde{\gamma}$ term in Equation \eqref{eq:nextFR} implies that an astronomical source located at $\rhat$ will preferentially appear at a fringe rate of $f \approx \rhat \cdot \mathbf{b} \times \boldsymbol \omega_\Earth \nu / c $ in the data. Since $\rhat \cdot \mathbf{b} \times \boldsymbol \omega_\Earth$ can never exceed $b \omega_\Earth $, the maximal fringe-rate that can be achieved by a source locked to the celestial sphere is $f_\textrm{max} = b \omega_\Earth  \nu / c$, where $\omega_\Earth \equiv | \boldsymbol \omega_\Earth|$ and $b \equiv | \mathbf{b}|$. Data at even higher fringe rates will likely be noise- rather than signal-dominated and may be filtered out safely with no loss of signal. This is a more tailored approach to reducing time-ordered data than simply averaging visibilities together in time. The latter can be viewed as a boxcar convolution in the time domain, which corresponds to applying a sinc filter in fringe-rate space. With wings that only decay as $1/f$, a sinc filter tends to incorporate data from the noise-dominated high fringe rate modes. A fringe-rate filter, in contrast, can be more carefully tailored to enhance modes that are sourced by actual emission from the celestial sphere.

In this section, we have provided some basic intuition for fringe-rate filtering, and have highlighted how it can be used in for reshaping one's primary beam as well as to combine time-ordered data. In fact, these two applications are often intimately linked, since optimal prescriptions for combining time-ordered data (``mapmaking") involve re-weighting data by the primary beam \citep{T97mapmaking,Morales2009,dillon_et_al2015}. We will return to this in Section \ref{sec:Mapmaking}, where we will see that the fringe-rate filtering is a particular natural way to approach mapmaking in interferometric observations.

%One way of handling this additional integration is via gridding in the $uv$-plane.
%Each measured visibility in a wide-field interferometer represents the integral over a kernel in
%the $uv$-plane that reflects the primary beam of the elements \citep{bhatnagar_et_al2008,morales_matejek2009} and the $w$ component 
%of the baseline \citep{cornwell_et_al2003}.  As noted in
%\citet{sullivan_et_al2012} and \citet{morales_matejek2009},
%in order to optimally account for the mode-mixing introduced by these kernels, gridding kernels must be
%used that correctly distribute each measurement among the sampled $uv$-modes, such that, in the ensemble average
%over many measurements by many baselines, each $uv$-mode becomes an optimally weighted estimator of the actual
%value given the set of measurements.
%
%However, this approach has a major shortcoming when applied to maximum-redundancy array configurations.
%In order
%to maximize sensitivity, such
%configurations are set up to deliberately sample identical visibilities that reflect the same 
%combinations of modes in the $uv$ plane, with few nearby measurements (P12a).  As a result,
%such array configurations tend to lack enough measurements of different combinations of $uv$ modes
%to permit the ensemble average to converge on the true value.  Said differently, maximum-redundancy
%array configurations tend to produce measurement sets that, when expressed as linear combinations
%of $uv$-modes of interest, are singular.
%
%Our alternative approach avoids this and many of the difficulties outlined
%in \citet{hazelton_et_al2013} by applying a carefully tailored
%fringe-rate filter to each time series of visibility spectra.

%Similar geometric limits apply to the variation of visibilities in the time dimension.  As
%described in Equation 7 of \citet{parsons_backer2009}, the rate of change of the geometric delay versus
%time --- that is, delay-rate --- is given by
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{d\tau_g}{dt}=-\omega_\oplus\left(\frac{b_x}{c}\sin H + \frac{b_y}{c}\cos H\right)\cos\delta,
%\end{equation}
%where $\b=(b_x,b_y,b_z)$ is the baseline vector expressed in equatorial
%coordinates, $\omega_\oplus$ is the angular frequency of the earth's rotation, and $H,\delta$ are the
%hour-angle and declination of a point on the celestial sphere, respectively.  As a result, there exists a maximum
%rate of change based on the length of a baseline projected to the $z=0$ equatorial plane.
%For arrays not deployed near the poles, $|b_y|\gg|b_x|$ (i.e.,
%they are oriented more along the east-west direction than radially from the polar axis),
%and the maximum rate of change corresponds to $H=0$ and $\delta=0$, where we have
%\begin{equation}
%-\omega_\oplus\frac{|b_y|}{c}\le\frac{d\tau_g}{dt}\le\omega_\oplus\frac{|b_y|}{c}.
%\end{equation}
%For a maximum east-west baseline length in the PAPER array of 300m, $\omega_\oplus|b_y|/c$ is approximately
%0.07 ns/s.  
%To better elucidate the meaning of this bound, we take the Fourier transform 
%along the time axis (see Equation 8 in \citealt{parsons_backer2009}) for a model visibility
%consisting of a single point source located at the point of maximum delay-rate, which gives us
%\begin{align}
%\Vt(\nu,f)&\approx\At(\nu,f) * \tilde{S}(\nu) * \int{e^{2\pi i\omega_\oplus\frac{b_y\nu}{c}t}e^{-2\pi ift}dt}\nonumber\\
%&\approx\At(\nu,f) * \tilde{S}(\nu) * \delta_{\rm D}(\frac{b_y}{c}\omega_\oplus \nu - f),
%\end{align}
%where $f$ is the fringe-rate of the 
%source\footnote{Delay rate is equivalent to the frequency-integrated fringe rate.}, 
%$\At(\nu,f)$ indicates the Fourier transform of the antenna response along the time direction,
%and approximation is
%indicated because we assume $|b_y|\gg|b_x|$, and because the Fourier transform must involve
%a discrete length of time, during which our assumption that $\cos H\approx1$ breaks down at second order.
%The delta function above gives rise to the expression for the maximum fringe rate in Equation \ref{eq:fringe_rate}.
%
%This example of a source with a maximal fringe-rate serves to show that a 
%filter may be applied in delay-rate domain, using the fact that the maximum
%delay-rate is bounded by the maximum fringe rate within the band (i.e. evaluating Equation \ref{eq:fringe_rate}
%at the maximum $\nu$ involved in the delay transform), to remove emission that exceeds the variation
%dictated by array geometry for sources locked to the celestial sphere.  As in the delay filtering case, assuming
%the geometric bounds on delay rate implicitly assumes that $\At$ and $\tilde{S}$ are compact in $f$, which
%is to say that instrumental responses and celestial emission must be smooth in time; variable
%emission from, e.g., fast-transients will be heavily suppressed by such delay-rate filters.
%For PAPER, with a maximum baseline length of 300m and a maximum observing frequency of 200 MHz, 
%the maximum delay-rate has a period of 68.5s.  As described in \S\ref{sec:fringe_rate_filtering}, at PAPER's
%latitude, delay-rates range from -$f_{\rm max}/2$ to $f_{\rm max}$.  Filtering delay-rates to this

\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:Implementation}

In this section, we discuss a practical implementation of fringe-rate filtering, which will be used in simulations to illustrate various applications of fringe-rate filtering later in the paper. In keeping with its origins targeting observations from the
PAPER array, we simulate a model array based on PAPER, deployed at a latitude $-30^\circ$
and featuring the beam response pattern characteristic of PAPER dipole elements \citep{parsons_et_al2008,pober_et_al2012}.
The PAPER beam response pattern is illustrated in the left panel of Figure \ref{fig:sim_beam}.
For these simulations, we also choose a specific baseline to examine: a pair of antennas separated by 30 m in the 
east-west direction, observing at 150 MHz.  This baseline corresponds to the most repeated (and hence,
most sensitive) baseline length measured by the PAPER array in the maximum-redundancy array configuration it uses
for power spectral measurements \citep{parsons_et_al2012a,P14,ali_et_al2015}.  As such, our simulations demonstrate the performance of fringe-rate filtering in the context of the specific instrument configuration
that has recently been used to place the current best upper limits on $21\,\textrm{cm}$ emission from cosmic reionization \citep{P14,J14}.

In the following sections, we will derive a number of different fringe-rate weights, each optimized for a different application. Often, these optimized weights depend on the detailed properties of one's instrument, and can therefore
only be computed numerically, not analytically. For example, we will find in Section \ref{sec:PspecOptimization} that the optimal fringe-rate weights for power spectrum estimation involve computing the root-mean-square primary beam
profile over contours of constant fringe-rate on the sky (such as those shown in Figure \ref{fig:fringe_contours}). A
realistic primary beam will frequently require empirical modeling beyond analytic forms. It is therefore in general difficult to derive a completely analytic expression for an optimized fringe-rate filter profile. However, in the interests of being able to rapidly generate filters as a function of varying baseline lengths and observing frequencies, we frequently fit analytic forms (such as truncated Gaussians) to the numerical profiles. As long as the numerical profiles take the optimized forms that we will derive in Section \ref{sec:bmsculpt}, small deviations arising from an imperfect analytic fit are unlikely to significantly shift the final error properties of one's measurements. With the discussion of power spectrum measurements in Section \ref{sec:PspecOptimization}, for example, we minimize the noise variance by varying the fringe-rate weights. Because our analytic fits to these weights start from a local minimum in noise variance, any deviations in the weighting profile will only induce small second-order increases in the final error bars.


%
%
%To implement
%the fringe-rate filters described below, we begin with the ideal filter shape in fringe-rate space.  In the case 
%of the beam-weighted fringe-rate filter described in \S\ref{sec:sim_nos}, this ideal filter shape takes a
%truncated Gaussian form where the peak and width have been fit to the projection of the beam model in fringe-rate space,
%as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:fringe_weights}.  
%The beam model projection is obtained
%by binning the beam power along fringe-rate contours, as illustrated for coarse fringe-rate bins
%in Figure \ref{fig:XXX}.  The analytic Gaussian form is then truncated at the maximum fringe rate to obtain a fringe-rate
%filter profile that matches the beam-weighted profile to within a power-averaged RMS of XXX\%.  While it would be possible
%to use the beam-weighted profile directly as the ideal fringe-rate filter profile, having an analytic form allows filters
%to be rapidly generated as a function of baseline length and observing frequency.  Since optimal SNR weighting is relatively
%insensitive to small weighting errors (XXX back this up), this level of match between the computed and analytic forms of the
%desired fringe-rate filter is acceptable.

The next step in implementing the fringe-rate filter is translating the analytic filter profile in fringe-rate space into 
a time-domain kernel that can be used to convolve the simulated time series of visibilities.  In effect, we implement
the fringe-rate filter as a finite impulse response (FIR) filter.  Applying the fringe-rate filter as an FIR filter in
the time domain, as opposed directly multiplying the desired filter to Fourier-transformed visibilities, has the advantage 
that flagged or missing data can be naturally excluded from the filter by neglecting
FIR taps (coefficient multiplies) that target the missing data. The summed output of the FIR filter are then renormalized to
account for the missing samples.  Another advantage of the FIR implementation of the fringe-rate filter is the potential for
windowing the time-domain filter profile.  While time-domain windowing causes further deviations from the ideal
fringe-rate filter profile, it can be used to produce a more compact time-domain kernel.
Reducing the number of time-domain samples used in the FIR filter improves the computational efficiency of the filter and
helps limit the number of samples potentially corrupted by spurious systematics such as radio frequency interference.


\section{Applications}
\label{sec:bmsculpt}

In Section \ref{sec:Implementation}, we discussed how a fringe-rate filter can be implemented in practice once a particular form for the filter is selected. In this section, we optimize the selection of filters (or equivalently, of fringe-rate weights) for various applications in low-frequency radio interferometry. The key to this optimization will be the insight from Section \ref{sec:overview}, namely that the effect of fringe-rate filtering can be regarded as both a time integration and a modification of the spatial response of the primary beam on a per-baseline basis. Turning this around, one can identify the optimal primary beam needed for one's observations, and then reverse engineer the set of fringe-rates needed to achieve this beam in what is essentially a ``beam sculpting" operation. For concreteness, we will focus here on $21\,\textrm{cm}$ cosmology, but many of the ideas presented here are easily translatable to other applications of radio interferometry.

\subsection{Minimizing thermal noise errors in power spectrum measurements}
\label{sec:PspecOptimization}

In \citet{parsons_et_al2012a} and \citet{P14}, it was shown that estimates of the three-dimensional power spectrum of $21\,\textrm{cm}$ brightness temperature fluctuations could be obtained from a single baseline by Fourier transforming visibility data along the frequency axis (forming a ``delay spectrum"), and then taking the absolute square of the results. Here, we will show how fringe-rate weights can be chosen to maximize the sensitivity of a single-baseline-derived power spectrum.

We begin by considering a generalization of the derivation in \citet{P14}, where it was assumed that the primary beams of all elements in the interferometer are identical. We now consider the possibility of probing the power spectrum via a cross-correlation of two baselines with different primary beams. To be clear, our eventual discussion will be based on the analysis of fringe-rate filtered visibilities from a \emph{single} baseline. However, from Section \ref{sec:overview}, we saw that to a good approximation, selecting different fringe-rates is equivalent to observing the sky with different effective beams. Thus, the cross-correlation of visibilities from two different fringe-rate bins is mathematically identical to cross-correlating two baselines with different beams. To begin, suppose that the $i$th baseline consists of antenna elements with primary beam $A_i (\rhat)$. The delay-transformed visibility takes the form
\begin{equation}
\widetilde{V}_i(\mathbf{u},\eta) = \frac{2 k_B}{\lambda^2} \int  d^2 \mathbf{u}^\prime \, d\eta^\prime \widetilde{A}_i (\mathbf{u} -\mathbf{u}^\prime, \eta-\eta^\prime) \widetilde{T}(\mathbf{u}^\prime , \eta^\prime),
\end{equation}
where $\eta$ is the Fourier dual to frequency\footnote{This equation can be derived by Fourier transforming Equation 
\ref{eq:originalVis} along the frequency axis and re-expressing the angular integral in $uv$ coordinates assuming the flat-sky approximation. However, it also makes the crucial assumption that one can neglect the frequency-dependent nature of the mapping of baseline $\mathbf{b}$ to $\mathbf{u}$ coordinate. In practice, this is a good approximation only for short baselines \citep{parsons_et_al2012b,liu_et_al2014a} such as those used for power spectrum analyses in the PAPER experiment \citep{P14,J14,ali_et_al2015}.
}, $\widetilde{A}_i $ is the Fourier transform of $A_i (\rhat)$ in both the angular and spectral directions, $\widetilde{T}$ is the brightness temperature field in Fourier space, $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, $\lambda$ is the central observation frequency, and it is implicitly assumed that the baseline length is given by $\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{u} \lambda$, with $\mathbf{u} \equiv (u,v)$. From this, we can see that two baselines with different primary beams, but located at the same location on the $uv$ plane have a delay-spectrum cross-correlation given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:visCrossCorr}
\langle \widetilde{V}_i(\mathbf{u},\eta) \widetilde{V}_j(\mathbf{u},\eta)^*\rangle = \left( \frac{2 k_B}{\lambda^2} \right)^2 \int d^2 \mathbf{u}^\prime \, d\eta^\prime  P(\mathbf{u}^\prime , \eta^\prime) \nonumber \\
\times \widetilde{A}_i (\mathbf{u} -\mathbf{u}^\prime, \eta-\eta^\prime) \widetilde{A}_j^* (\mathbf{u} -\mathbf{u}^\prime, \eta-\eta^\prime) \nonumber \\
\approx P(\mathbf{u} , \eta) \left( \frac{2 k_B}{\lambda^2} \right)^2 \int d\Omega d\nu A_i (\rhat,\nu) A_j (\rhat,\nu), \quad
\end{eqnarray}
where angular brackets $\langle \dots \rangle$ denote an ensemble average over possible realizations of a random temperature field. In the first equality, we assumed that this field is a translation-invariant Gaussian random field specified by a power spectrum $P(\mathbf{u}, \eta)$, so that
\begin{equation}
\langle \widetilde{T}(\mathbf{u} , \eta) \widetilde{T}^*(\mathbf{u}^\prime , \eta^\prime)\rangle = \delta^{D} (\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{u}^\prime) \delta^D (\eta - \eta^\prime) P(\mathbf{u}, \eta).
\end{equation}
In the second equality, we made the approximation that for reasonably broad primary beams, $\widetilde{A}_i $ and $\widetilde{A}_j$ tend to be rather localized, which allows the comparatively broader $P(\mathbf{u}, \eta)$ to be factored out of the integral.\footnote{Although see \citet{liu_et_al2014b} for some limitations of this approximation.} Following this, we used Parseval's theorem to rewrite the integral over $(\mathbf{u},\eta)$ space as an integral over angles and frequency.

Rearranging Equation \eqref{eq:visCrossCorr} gives an expression for the true power spectrum in terms of the cross-correlation function of two delay-space visibilities. With real data, however, one cannot perform the ensemble average on the left-hand side of Equation \eqref{eq:visCrossCorr}. Omitting this ensemble average, the copy of the power spectrum on the right-hand side becomes an \emph{estimator} $\widehat{P}$ of the true power spectrum $P$. Introducing the definition
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Omega_ij_def}
\Omega_{ij} \equiv \frac{1}{B} \int d\Omega d\nu A_i (\rhat,\nu) A_j (\rhat,\nu),
\end{equation}
where $B$ is the bandwidth over which observations are made, our estimator takes the form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pspecEstCrossCorr}
\widehat{P} (\mathbf{k}) = \left( \frac{\lambda^2}{2 k_B} \right)^2 \frac{X^2 Y}{\Omega_{ij} B} \widetilde{V}_i(\mathbf{u},\eta) \widetilde{V}_j(\mathbf{u},\eta)^*,
\end{equation}
where we have written the power spectrum in terms of cosmological Fourier coordinates $\mathbf{k}$, which are related to the interferometric Fourier coordinates by $(X k_x, X k_y, Y k_z) \equiv 2 \pi (u , v, \eta)$, picking up an extra factor of $X^2 Y$ in the process,\footnote{See, e.g., \citet{liu_et_al2014a} for a detailed derivation.} with
\begin{equation}
X \equiv \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{dz^\prime}{E(z^\prime)}; \,\, E(z) \equiv \sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z)^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}.
\end{equation}
where $c$ is the speed of light, $z$ is the redshift of observation, $H_0$ is the Hubble parameter, $\Omega_m$ is the normalized matter density, $\Omega_\Lambda$ is the normalized dark energy density, and
\begin{equation}
Y \equiv  \frac{c(1+z)^2}{\nu_{21} H_0 E(z)},
\end{equation}
where $\nu_{21} \equiv 1420\,\textrm{MHz}$ is the rest frequency of the $21\,\textrm{cm}$ line. In the special case where there is just a single primary beam, we may set $i=j$ and drop the subscripts for brevity, and Equation \eqref{eq:pspecEstCrossCorr} reduces to
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:P14est}
\widehat{P} (\mathbf{k}) = \left( \frac{\lambda^2}{2 k_B} \right)^2 \frac{X^2 Y}{\Omega_{pp} B} | \widetilde{V}(\mathbf{u},\eta) |^2,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{pp} \equiv \frac{1}{B} \int d\Omega d\nu |A (\rhat,\nu)|^2,
\end{equation}
which is the relation found in \citet{P14}.

Having established these results, let us re-interpret Equation \eqref{eq:pspecEstCrossCorr} as an estimator for the power spectrum from the cross-multiplication of two different discretized fringe rate bins (as opposed to the cross-multiplication of baselines with different primary beams). We are free to re-interpret our estimator in this way because of the discussion in Section \ref{sec:overview}, where we showed that each visibility could be thought of as being comprised of different fringe rate contributions, each probing a different ring on the celestial sphere. Each fringe-rate therefore has its own effective primary beam, enabling our re-interpretation. That Equation \eqref{eq:pspecEstCrossCorr} involves the cross-multiplication of visibilities after they have been delay-transformed over the frequency axis is not a problem, since the Fourier transforms required to enact the delay transform and the fringe-rate transform commute with one another.

Equation \eqref{eq:pspecEstCrossCorr} allows a power spectrum to be estimated from the cross-multiplication of any pair of fringe-rate bins. To increase signal-to-noise on the measurement, however, one ought to form all possible cross-multiplied pairs, which can then combined into a single power spectrum estimate via a weighted average. Suppressing the arguments of $\widehat{P}$ and $\widetilde{V}$ for notational cleanliness, we can write
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wVV}
\widehat{P} = \sum_{ij} w_{ij} \widetilde{V}_i \widetilde{V}_j^*,
\end{equation}
where $w_{ij}$ is the weight assigned to the cross-multiplication of the $i$th and $j$th fringe-rate bins. Our goal is to select weights that minimize the error bars on the final power spectrum estimate. 

For our optimization exercise, assume that errors are due to instrumental thermal noise only. If the $i$th fringe-rate bin has a noise contribution of $n_i$, the noise contribution to our estimator is
\begin{equation}
\widehat{P}_\textrm{noise} = \sum_{ij} w_{ij} n_i n_j^*.
\end{equation}
The error bar corresponding to this noise contribution is given by the square root of its variance, which takes the form
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:NoiseVar}
\textrm{Var}(\widehat{P}_\textrm{noise} ) &\equiv& \langle \widehat{P}_\textrm{noise}^2 \rangle - \langle \widehat{P}_\textrm{noise} \rangle^2 \nonumber \\
&= & \sum_{ijkm} w_{ij} w_{km} \left[ \langle n_i n_j^* n_k n_m^* \rangle - \langle n_i n_j^*\rangle \langle n_k n_m^* \rangle \right] \nonumber \\
&=&  \sum_{ij} w_{ij} w_{ji}\sigma^4,
\end{eqnarray}
where in the last equality we assumed that the noise is Gaussian, enabling the fourth moment term to be written as a sum of second moment (variance) terms. We further assumed that the real and imaginary components of the noise are uncorrelated with each other and between different fringe-rate bins, so that if $n_i \equiv a_i + i b_i$, we have $\langle a_i a_j \rangle = \langle b_i b_j \rangle = \delta_{ij} \sigma^2/2 $ and $\langle a_i b_j \rangle= 0$ for all $i$ and $j$.

In minimizing the noise variance, care must be taken to ensure that there is no signal loss in the power spectrum estimation. To do so, we first note that taking the ensemble average of $\widehat{P}$ gives
\begin{equation}
\langle \widehat{P} \rangle = \sum_{ij} w_{ij} \langle \widetilde{V}_i \widetilde{V}_j^* \rangle = S \sum_{ij} w_{ij} \Omega_{ij} P,
\end{equation}
where we used an ensemble-averaged version of Equation \eqref{eq:pspecEstCrossCorr} to relate the true cross-correlation to the true power spectrum, and defined $S \equiv ( B / X^2 Y) ( 2 k_B / \lambda^2 )^2$. Ensuring that there is no signal loss is thus tantamount to requiring that $ S \sum_{ij} w_{ij} \Omega_{ij} =1$, so that $\langle \widehat{P} \rangle = P$. We may impose this constraint by introducing a Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ in our minimization of the noise variance, minimizing
\begin{equation}
\mathcal L = \sum_{ij} w_{ij} w_{ji} - \lambda \sum_{ij} w_{ij} \Omega_{ij},
\end{equation}
where both $\sigma^4$ and $S$ have been absorbed into our definition of $\lambda$. Differentiating with respect to each element and setting the result to zero gives an optimized weight given by $w_{km} \propto \Omega_{km}$, and normalizing according to our constraint yields
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:PspecOptWeights}
w_{km} = \frac{\Omega_{km}}{S \sum_{ij} \Omega_{ij}^2}.
\end{equation}

To make intuitive sense of this, let us make a few more approximations. The key quantity here is $\Omega_{ij}$, which we can see from Equation \eqref{eq:Omega_ij_def} is the overlap integral between the effective primary beams of the $i$th and $j$th fringe-rate bins. In Section \ref{sec:overview}, we saw that if one takes the fringe-rate Fourier transform over a wide enough window in time, different fringe-rates map to different portions of the sky with relatively little overlap. If this is indeed the case, $\Omega_{ij}$ vanishes unless $i=j$. Defining
\begin{equation}
\mu_i  \equiv \frac{1}{B} \int d\Omega d\nu A_i(\rhat,\nu)^2,
\end{equation}
we have $\Omega_{ij} \equiv \delta_{ij} \mu_i$, so our optimal estimator for the power spectrum reduces to
\begin{equation}
\widehat{P} = \frac{1}{S \sum_j \mu_j^2}\sum_i \mu_i | \widetilde{V}_i |^2 .
\end{equation}
Suppose we now define $\mu_i^{1/2} \widetilde{V}_i$ to be an optimally weighted visibility in fringe-rate space. Transforming back to the time domain using Parseval's theorem, one obtains
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:finalEst}
\widehat{P}(\mathbf{u}, \eta) = \left( \frac{\lambda^2}{2 k_B} \right)^2 \frac{X^2 Y}{B\sum_j \mu_j^2} \sum_i |\widetilde{V}^\textrm{opt} (\mathbf{u}, \eta; t_i)|^2,
\end{equation}
where the optimally filtered visibility in the time domain $\widetilde{V}^\textrm{opt} (\mathbf{u}, \eta; t_i)$ is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\widetilde{V}^\textrm{opt} (\mathbf{u}, \eta; t_i) &\equiv& \sum_i e^{i 2 \pi f t} \mu_i^{1/2} \widetilde{V}_i \nonumber \\
&=&  \sum_i e^{i 2 \pi f t} \left[\frac{1}{B} \int d\Omega d\nu A_i(\rhat,\nu)^2\right]^\frac{1}{2} \widetilde{V}_i. \qquad
\end{eqnarray}
This is a rather remarkable result, in that the optimal power spectrum estimator for a single baseline interferometer consists of a squared statistic (i.e., one with no phase information) integrated in time. This may seem counterintuitive, particularly if one is accustomed to more conventional techniques where images are formed from the visibilities and averaged down before any squaring steps. There, it is crucial to average in time \emph{before} squaring, because data from different time steps can be sourced by the same Fourier modes on the celestial sphere. Integrating before squaring allows information from these modes to be coherently averaged together (since phase information has yet to be discarded), resulting in instrumental noise that integrates down as $1/\sqrt{t}$. This then becomes a $1/t$ dependence for the error bars on the final (squared) power spectrum results, and is a much quicker reduction of instrumental noise than if the data had been squared first, which would have resulted in a $1/\sqrt{t}$ dependence on the power spectrum errors.

In our derivation, we showed that the optimal power spectrum estimator can in fact be obtained by squaring before integrating, \emph{provided} the power spectra formed at each time instant are first fringe-rate filtered with weights $ \mu_i^{1/2}$, i.e., where each fringe-rate is weighted by the root-mean-square primary beam within the corresponding constant-fringe-rate contour on the sky. Essentially, the pre-processing step of fringe-rate filtering (with these specific weights) replaces the independent time samples with a set of correlated visibilities that have effectively already been coherently integrated in time. Note that these weights are \emph{not} in general the same as the ones derived in Section \ref{fringeRateIntro} for optimal mapmaking, where measurements were essentially weighted by an additional factor of the primary beam in fringe-rate space, rather than by the root-mean-square beam weighting suggested here. Put another way, to obtain the full power spectrum sensitivity of an interferometer, it is insufficient
to simply square the Fourier amplitudes outputted from a map, even if the mapmaking was optimized to minimize the error bars of the map.  Forming the power spectrum in such a way would be equivalent to restricting $w_{ij}$ to a form separable in $i$ and $j$, which is a restriction that precludes the form for $w_{ij}$ given by Equation \ref{eq:PspecOptWeights}, which minimizes the error bars of the power spectrum.

Importantly, the result that we have derived here applies only when one is attempting to measure a power spectrum with a single baseline (or multiple baselines with the same baseline vector $\mathbf{b}$). This is a reasonable limit to work in for arrays such as PAPER, where a large fraction of the array's sensitivity comes from instantaneously redundant baselines \citep{parsons_et_al2012a}. For arrays that have less instantaneous redundancy, it becomes more important to combine data from multiple baselines. If multiple baselines are involved, Equation \eqref{eq:finalEst} no longer reduces to a single sum over the time axis. Said differently, it is no longer true that the full sensitivity of an array can be obtained by averaging together time-slice-by-time-slice estimates of the power spectrum estimation from fringe-rate filtered data. Instead, the optimal estimator involves a double sum over time, since with multiple baselines of roughly the same length, it is possible for baselines to rotate into one another. That is, rotation synthesis becomes an important contribution to an interferometer's sensitivity.

In closing, we note that following fringe-rate filtering, the normalization of the power spectrum estimator must be modified accordingly. This can be seen in Equation \eqref{eq:finalEst}, where the scalar quantities in front of the sum are different than those found in Equation \eqref{eq:P14est}, which is applicable to non-fringe rate filtered data. To ensure that one's power spectrum estimates are correctly normalized, one can simply follow the prescription in Equation \eqref{eq:finalEst}. However, the derivation of Equation \eqref{eq:finalEst} involved a number of approximations. Additionally, as we discussed in Section \ref{sec:Implementation}, practical implementations of fringe-rate filtering may deviate from the optimal prescription outlined here. It may therefore be safer to instead compute the normalization of the power spectrum numerically. Once the fringe-rate weights have been specified, Equation \eqref{eq:EffectiveBeamDef} gives the effective beam. Since we know from Equation \eqref{eq:ShrunkBeam} that the measurement equation for fringe-rate filtered visibilities is the same as that for the original visibilities up to the revised beam, one can simply use Equation \eqref{eq:P14est} as long as the beam area is accordingly revised.

In Figure XXX, we show... [XXX uncomment out stuff below to talk about the simulations]
%To summarize, the simulations are based on a 30-m PAPER baseline observing at 150 MHz.  While the shape of the fringe-rate
%filter is application-specific, we generally implement them as FIR filters, with time-domain kernels using coefficients that
%are spaced to match the 43-second integrations recorded in our simulated observations.  Finally, we apply an window function to
%truncate the wings of this time-domain kernel to increase its compactness in time.  As demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:fringe_weights},
%% XXX add this part to the plot
%this windowing increases the power-averaged RMS deviation from the ideal filter to XXX\%, but the improvement in computational cost,
%the reduction in impact for any spurious systematics, and the relative insensitivity of the applications described below on the specific
%filter shape, make this an advantageous trade-off.

In the previous section, we maximized our sensitivity to the power spectrum under the assumption that the measurements were limited by instrumental noise. In practice, however, there may other sources of noise or systematics that may limit our constraints. One example of this is the cross-contamination between Stokes terms in interferometric polarization measurements. Minimizing such contamination is of paramount importance for $21\,\textrm{cm}$ cosmology experiments that rely on
the spectral axis to probe the line-of-sight direction at cosmological distances.  For these
experiments, Faraday rotation combines
with a spurious coupling between Stokes terms (typically $Q$ to $I$) to produce polarization leakage whose 
spectral structure poses a worrisome foreground
to the cosmological signal \citep{jelic_et_al2008,moore_et_al2013,moore_et_al2015}.  Current interferometers
targeting the 21cm signal at cosmological distances (LOFAR, MWA, PAPER, HERA, CHIME, LEDA) all employ linearly
polarized feeds, primarily because of their ease of construction and ability to co-locate elements sensitive to
orthogonal polarizations.  However, orthogonal linearly polarized feeds in practice have primary beam responses
that do not match.  As described in \citet{moore_et_al2013}, if left uncorrected, the unmatched beam response 
between visibilities $\VXX$ and $\VYY$ measuring the XX and YY polarization products, respectively, is the 
dominant source of polarization leakage in the Stokes I measurement $\VI\equiv(\VXX+\VYY)/2$ for
linearly polarized feeds.

With an accurate beam model, it is trivial to rescale $\VXX$ and $\VYY$ 
so that the XX and YY beam responses match in one particular direction (typically the zenith).  Their sum, $\VI$, then
represents a perfect probe of the Stokes I parameter in that chosen direction, but will contain contamination
from $\VQ\equiv(\VXX-\VYY)/2$ in directions where the XX and YY beam responses do not match.
The heart of the problem is the impossibility of creating a match between a pair of two-dimensional functions (the
XX and YY beam responses) with a single degree of freedom (the amplitude of $\VXX$ relative to $\VYY$).  In order
to improve the match between polarization beams in interferometric measurements, many interferometric measurements
from distinct points in the $uv$ plane will have to be combined with appropriate weights to effect a reweighting
of the sky along two dimensions.

The typical technique for correcting the mismatch between the XX and YY polarization beams is to separately
image these polarization products, correct each pixel in each image using modeled beam responses,
and then to sum the corrected images together to form a Stokes I map 
(e.g., \citealt{sullivan,lofar,bernardi}).  Mathematically, this technique is identical to convolving the sampled
$uv$ plane by the Fourier transform of the directionally-dependent correction applied in the image domain, and for an ideal
array that samples the $uv$ plane at scales significantly finer than the aperture of a single element, this technique can
in principle perfectly correct mismatches between the XX and YY polariation beams.
However, the success that can be achieved with this technique depends strongly on an array's $uv$ sampling pattern.

Take, for example, the case of a sparsely sampled $uv$ plane where the spacing between $uv$ samples is much greater than
the aperture scale of a single element.  In this case, the beam correction described above 
convolves each $uv$ sample with a kernel whose size scales roughly as the size of the aperture of a
single element in wavelengths.  Since this kernel is much smaller than the spacing between $uv$ samples, 
each point in the convolved $uv$ plane is dominated by the product of a kernel weight and a single visibility measurement.
As such, for a chosen $uv$ coordinate, the level of leakage in the Stokes I $uv$ plane can
be no better than what can be achieved by using a single number to rescale $\VXX$ and $\VYY$ before summing.  

For cases where $uv$ sampling falls somewhere between the sparse and the oversampled cases described above, the level
of primary beam correction that can be realized is more complicated.  Ultimately, the Fourier relationship between
the $uv$ plane and the image dictates that samples that are nearby to one
another in the $uv$ plane enable primary beam corrections on the largest angular scales, while samples that are farther
apart contribute to corrections on finer angular scales, with the orientation of the samples relative to one another
dictating the axis along which such corrections take effect in image domain.  Typically, earth-rotation synthesis
is required to sample the $uv$ plane densely enough to allow for effective beam correction, although some array
configurations are not dense enough to fully correct the beam even then.  One particularly relevant case that falls
in this last category are many of the maximum redundancy configurations currently favored by several $21\,\textrm{cm}$ cosmology experiments
for their sensitivity benefits \citep{parsons_et_al2012a,P14}.

However, even in the single-baseline case, earth-rotation synthesis provides dense $uv$ sampling along one direction: the
direction the baseline traverses in the $uv$ plane as its project toward the phase center changes.  The appropriate
convolution kernel can combine samples along this track so as to correct the primary beam mismatch along one axis.
Of course, what we have just described---a convolution kernel acting along a time series
of samples from a single baseline---is precisely fringe-rate filtering.  Put another way, since fringe-rate filtering has the effect of modifying one's primary beams, it is possible to tailor fringe-rates to improve the match between the XX and YY polarization beams. In the case of sparse array sampling, the result will be identical to the best that can be achieved by independently
imaging the polarization products.  While this is not as effective at mitigating polarization leakage as can be achieved
through imaging in the dense sampling case, we will now show that it nonetheless represents a substantial improvement
over the naive summing of XX and YY visibility measurements.

We begin by seeking mathematically optimized fringe-rate weights that
simultaneously reduce polarization leakage and instrumental noise errors.
Suppose the XX polarization product has an antenna power beam of $A_{\rm XX}$, while the YY 
polarization product has an antenna power beam of $A_{\rm YY}$. The primary beam that we have denoted $A(\rhat)$ 
in previous sections is given by $A_{\rm XX} + A_{\rm YY}$, which will be labeled as $A^I(\rhat)$ in this section to emphasize
its meaning as the antenna response to the Stokes I sky. Defining $A^Q(\rhat) \equiv A_{\rm XX} - A_{\rm YY}$, the
Stokes I visibility takes the form
\begin{eqnarray}
V_{b\nu}(t)= &&\int d\Omega \, {I_\nu(\rhat) A^I_\nu(\rhat,t) \exp \left[-i2\pi \frac{\nu}{c}  \mathbf{b}(t) \cdot \rhat\right]} + \nonumber \\
&& \int d\Omega \, {Q_\nu(\rhat) A^Q_\nu(\rhat,t) \exp \left[-i2\pi \frac{\nu}{c}  \mathbf{b}(t) \cdot \rhat\right]}, \qquad
\end{eqnarray}
where $Q_\nu$ denotes the Stokes Q sky at frequency $\nu$. The second term represents the $Q$ to $I$ leakage
in the visibility measurement, which vanishes if $ A_{\rm XX} = A_{\rm YY}$, i.e., if the beams are symmetric. In what follows we consider how this leakage manifests itself in the power spectrum
and how one's fringe-rate weights can be adjusted to mitigate its harmful effects.

Like before, the correlation function of delay-transformed visibilities provides the connection between our
measurements and our power spectra. Including the $Q$ to $I$ leakage term, Equation \eqref{eq:visCrossCorr}
becomes
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:LeakyCorrelFct}
\langle \widetilde{V}_i(\mathbf{u},\eta) \widetilde{V}_j(\mathbf{u},\eta)^*\rangle \approx S \left[P_I (\mathbf{k}) \Omega_{ij}^I + P_Q (\mathbf{k}) \Omega_{ij}^Q\right],
\end{equation}
where $S \equiv ( B / X^2 Y) ( 2 k_B / \lambda^2 )^2$ and $(X k_x, X k_y, Y k_z) \equiv 2 \pi (u , v, \eta)$, as before. The indices $i$ and $j$ again index fringe-rate
bins. Beam integrals $\Omega^Q$ and $\Omega^I$ are defined analogously to Equation \eqref{eq:Omega_ij_def},
but with superscripts indicating the Stokes components. The Stokes I power spectrum $P_I$ is the same as the
power spectrum $P$ defined in Section \ref{sec:PspecOptimization}, with the new notation serving only to
distinguish it from the Stokes Q power $P_Q$. In deriving Equation \eqref{eq:LeakyCorrelFct}, we made two
key assumptions. The first is that the $I$ and $Q$ contributions to the sky are on average uncorrelated. Empirically, 
this appears to be the case [XXX: cite someone?], and physically, one expects [XXX: insert good physical reason].
The second assumption is that the polarized sky is describable by a power spectrum. At some level, one expects
this assumption to fail, as there exist bright polarized sources that are not accounted for in a random realization
of some power spectrum. However, since our ultimate goal is to measure power spectra, it is reasonable to
define an effective Stokes Q power spectrum.

Suppose we estimate the power spectrum by forming weighted averages of the visibility cross-correlations between all
pairs of fringe-rate bins. The general form for such an estimator is given by Equation \eqref{eq:wVV}. However,
as we found in Section \ref{sec:PspecOptimization}, one may approximate the different fringe-rate bins as being
uncorrelated. The same approximation can be made here, allowing us to define $\mu^I$ and $\mu^Q$ by
letting $\Omega_{ij}^I \equiv \delta_{ij} \mu_i^I$ and $\Omega_{ij}^Q \equiv \delta_{ij} \mu_i^Q$. With no
correlations between fringe-rate bins, it becomes sufficient to estimate the power spectrum using auto-correlations
only, with an estimator of the form
\begin{equation}
\widehat{P} = \sum_{i} g_{i}| \widetilde{V}_i |^2,
\end{equation}
where $g_i$ is the weight given to the auto-correlation of the $i$th fringe rate. Taking the ensemble average gives
\begin{equation}
\langle \widehat{P} \rangle = \left( S \sum_i g_i \mu^I_i \right) P_I + \left( S \sum_i g_i \mu^Q_i \right) P_Q.
\end{equation}
If, as before, we require our weights to be normalized so that $S \sum_i g_i \mu^I_i =1$, the first term gives an
unbiased estimator of the Stokes I power spectrum. The second term is the bias in our final power spectrum estimate
due to leakage from $Q$ to $I$. Ideally, the weights are chosen to mitigate this contribution. However, in attempting to
minimize this systematic, one must be careful not to pick weights that dramatically amplify the instrumental noise
contribution. We therefore choose to minimize an overall ``variance" that is the noise variance of Equation
\eqref{eq:NoiseVar} plus the square of the Stokes Q power spectrum bias (essentially adding the error bars
from instrumental noise and polarization leakage in quadrature). In other words, we minimize
\begin{equation}
\mathcal L = \sigma^4 \mathbf{g} \cdot \mathbf{g} + \left(S P_Q \right)^2 \left(\mathbf{g} \cdot \boldsymbol \mu^Q \right)^2 - \lambda \mathbf{g} \cdot \boldsymbol \mu^I,
\end{equation}
where we have introduced a Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ to enforce our normalization constraint, and have grouped
the different fringe-rate weights into a vector $\mathbf{g}$, with the beam overlap integrals similarly grouped into
vectors $\boldsymbol \mu^I$ and $\boldsymbol \mu^Q$. Now, notice that if we define
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{H} \equiv \sigma^4 \mathbf{I} + \left(S P_Q \right)^2 \boldsymbol \mu^Q (\boldsymbol \mu^Q)^t,
\end{equation}
our expression can be written as
\begin{equation}
\mathcal L = \mathbf{g}^t \mathbf{H} \mathbf{g} - \lambda \mathbf{g}^t \boldsymbol \mu^I.
\end{equation}
Differentiating this, setting the result to zero, and solving for the normalized weights gives
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:PolOptWeights}
\mathbf{g} =  \frac{\mathbf{H}^{-1}  \boldsymbol \mu^I}{ S (\boldsymbol \mu^I)^t  \mathbf{H}^{-1}  \boldsymbol \mu^I}.
\end{equation}
This expression involves $\mathbf{H}^{-1}$, which can be evaluated quite explicitly in our case using the
Woodbury formula, giving
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Hinv}
\mathbf{H}^{-1} = \sigma^{-4} \left[ \mathbf{I} - \frac{P_Q^2\boldsymbol \mu^Q (\boldsymbol \mu^Q)^t }{P_N^2 + P_Q^2 \boldsymbol \mu^Q \cdot \boldsymbol \mu^Q} \right],
\end{equation}
where $P_N$ is the noise power spectrum, which is equal to the root-mean-square visibility
noise divided by by $S$. If the sky were completely unpolarized ($P_Q = 0$) or there were no polarization leakage due to mismatched beams ($\boldsymbol \mu^Q = 0$), then $\mathbf{H}^{-1} \propto \mathbf{I}$, and the optimal weighting would take the form
$\mathbf{g} \propto \boldsymbol \mu^I$. Recalling that each component of a $\boldsymbol \mu$ vector corresponds
to a different fringe rate, we see that $\mathbf{g} \propto \boldsymbol \mu^I$ is precisely the result derived in Section
\ref{sec:PspecOptimization}, where each fringe-rate bin was weighted by the integrated square of the beam within the bin.

With polarization leakage, Equation \eqref{eq:PolOptWeights} shows that as a first step, one should still weight by
the square-integrated beam within each fringe-rate bin. However, one should then further weight by the more complicated
form for $\mathbf{H}^{-1}$ given by Equation \eqref{eq:Hinv}. To gain some intuition for
this operation, consider the limit of zero instrumental noise. One then obtains 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{H}^{-1} \Big{|}_{P_N =0} \propto \mathbf{I} - \boldsymbol \mu^Q (\boldsymbol \mu^Q \cdot \boldsymbol
\mu^Q )^{-1} (\boldsymbol \mu^Q )^t,
\end{equation}
which we immediately recognize as a projection matrix that projects out the vector $\boldsymbol \mu^Q$. Since the
components of $\boldsymbol \mu^Q$ encode the polarization leakage response in various
fringe-rate bins, $\mathbf{H}^{-1}$ projects out linear combinations of
fringe rates that are indicative of $Q$ to $I$ leakage due to beam asymmetries. At the other
extreme, if the polarization power spectrum is weak compared to the noise power spectrum,
we have
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{H}^{-1} \Big{|}_{P_N \gg P_Q} \propto \mathbf{I} - \left(\frac{P_Q}{P_N} \right)^2 \boldsymbol \mu^Q  (\boldsymbol \mu^Q )^t,
\end{equation}
which is similar to a projection operator, but with the unwanted/projected piece tempered
by the square of the small parameter $P_Q / P_N$. Intuitively, even modes that are
contaminated by polarization leakage contain cosmological information, and it is advantageous
to avoid too drastic a projection if possible. An overly aggressive subtraction of leakage
modes results in a loss of cosmological signal, which when corrected for by the altered
normalization of the power spectrum, results in a magnification of the error bars. For the
general case of intermediate noise levels, the $\mathbf{H}^{-1}$ smoothly interpolates
between the two extremes.

While mathematically optimal, the fringe-rate weighting proposed here is currently difficult
to put into practice. This is because the $Q$ power spectrum $P_Q$ has yet to be positively
measured at low frequencies. For example, recent measurements in \citet{moore_et_al2015}
[XXX: add other cites?] provide only upper limits on $P_Q$. With only upper limits, it is easy
to inadvertently employ a weighting that downweights polarization leakage in an overly
conservative manner, although it is of course welcome news that the polarized foregrounds
seem to be rather dim.

Absent a rigorous estimate of $P_Q$, we may turn once again to a more heuristic approach
to fringe-rate weighting. Again, we make use of the fact that given a set of weights, the effect
of fringe-rate filtering can be approximately captured as a modification of the primary beam.
Thus, we may use Equation \eqref{eq:pspecEstCrossCorr} (bearing in mind that the
$\Omega_{ij}$ there is the Stokes I version, i.e., $\Omega_{ij}^I$), but simply adjust for the
modified effective beam area. From Equation \eqref{eq:LeakyCorrelFct}, we see that doing
so gives a polarization leakage bias of $P_Q \Omega_{ij}^Q / \Omega_{ij}^I$. Thus, for any
weights that we choose, a suitable metric for quantifying polarization leakage is
$\Omega_{ij}^Q / \Omega_{ij}^I$, as was also identified in \citet{moore_et_al2015}. This
must be balanced by the thermal noise error bars, which are proportional to $1 / \Omega_{ij}^I$.
This can be seen from Equation \eqref{eq:pspecEstCrossCorr}, recalling the fact that
the instrumental noise enters at the visibilities, and therefore are magnified (or diminished) by
a factor of $1 / \Omega_{ij}^I$ as one forms the power spectrum.

% XXX cite ellingson somewhere?  what does his paper say?

A final application of beam sculpting with fringe-rate filters targets the suppression of systematics in data.
We will consider two systematics: additive phase terms associated with instrumental crosstalk, and sidelobes
associated with celestial emission outside of the primary field of interest.  Both of these applications are 
closely aligned with the original application of fringe-rate filters described in \citet{parsons_backer2009}.

For the purposes of this discussion, we consider instrumental crosstalk to be a spurious 
correlation introduced between otherwise uncorrelated signals
as a result of electromagnetic coupling in the instrument (typically between adjacent, unshielded signal lines)
or because a non-celestial source has injected a correlated signal (e.g. switching noise on power supplies).
Although crosstalk can be suppressed using Walsh switching (XXX cite), it is always present at some level
in interferometric observations.  If it is temporally stable, however, it is possible to significantly
suppress crosstalk in data by averaging visibilities over a long period (so that the fringing celestial
signal washes out) and then subtracting the average complex additive offset from the data.  This 
technique has
long been applied to, e.g., PAPER observations \citep{parsons_et_al2010,jacobs_et_al,pober_et_al,P14}.

As a time-domain filter, this crosstalk removal technique can also naturally be understood as a notch filter
for removing signals with zero fringe-rate.  Because crosstalk removal uses a finite time interval for computing
the average, applying this notch fringe-rate filter has the effect of removing emission from the region of
sky corresponding to the zero fringe-rate bin.  As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:fringe_contours}, for
a 30-m baseline observing at 150 MHz, this corresponds to the unshaded region intersecting the south celestial pole.
For PAPER, this region is sufficiently low in the beam that its removal has little impact, but in general, 
subsequent analysis of crosstalk-removed data may require accounting for the beam-sculpting effects of
the crosstalk removal filter.

Thus, when considering instrumental systematics, there may be additional criteria that influence one's
choice of fringe-rate filter besides optimizing signal-to-noise; one may choose to excise the zero fringe-rate
bin to improve data quality at a very modest cost to sensitivity.  Similarly, it is common to encounter situations
where celestial emission that is low in the primary beam is bright enough to introduce undesireable 
sidelobe structure or other systematics in observations targeting an area nearer to beam center.  In this case,
one may again find it desirable to depart from optimal weighting derived in Section \ref{sec:PspecOptimization}
by further down-weighting regions of low sensitivity in order to gain improvements in foreground systematics.
This application of fringe-rate filtering is particularly relevant for 21cm cosmology experiments where approximately
Gaussian signals are overlaid with highly non-Gaussian foregrounds.  Fringe-rate filters that are informed by 
the angular structure in foreground models can substantially suppress foreground systematics while having little
impact on a statistically isotropic Gaussian signal.

\section{Fringe-rate filtering as mapmaking from time-ordered data}
\label{sec:Mapmaking}

In the previous sections, we have focused on applications of fringe-rate filtering that operate on a single baseline basis. These applications are particularly powerful for maximally redundant arrays such at PAPER, which have most of their sensitivity concentrated in multiple identical copies of a small handful of baseline types. By design, maximally redundant arrays are not optimized for imaging, which instead require arrays that sample a large number of unique baselines. In this section, we turn our attention to such arrays, tackling the imaging (i.e., mapmaking) problem for multi-baseline arrays. We will find once that the fringe-rate space is particularly well-suited for implementing time integration for interferometric data.

%In this section, our goal is to examine how time-ordered visibilities from an
%interferometer should be best combined into information about the sky (such as
%an image-domain map).  Contrary to expectations, we will find that it is
%suboptimal to pursue the traditional, straightforward approach of averaging
%data in time, in the sense that such a procedure gives rise to
%larger-than-necessary error bars.  Instead, employing an unbiased,
%minimum-variance prescription naturally yields the technique of
%\emph{fringe-rate filtering}, the subject of this paper.

Suppose our time-ordered visibilities are grouped into a measurement vector
$\vis$ of length $N_b N_t$, where $N_b$ is the number of baselines, and $N_t$
is the number of snapshots taken in time.  If we represent the true sky as a
vector $\x$ of length $N_\textrm{pix}$, and our instrument's response as a
matrix $\A$ of size $N_b N_t \times N_\textrm{pix}$, the measurement equation
is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{measEqn}
\vis = \A \x + \mathbf{n},
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{n}$ is a noise vector.  Note that in this general form, Equation
\eqref{measEqn} is not basis-specific.  For example, while it is often useful
to think of $\x$ as a vector containing a list of temperatures in a set of
pixels on the sky (hence the variable name $N_\textrm{pix}$), it is equally
valid to employ another basis, such as spherical harmonics.  Similarly, while
we call $\vis$ the time-ordered data, it need not be a time series, and in
fact, we will see that a description in fringe-rate space is in fact the most natural.

Given our measurement $\vis$, the optimal estimator $\xhat$ of the true sky
$\x$ is given by \citep{T97mapmaking,Morales2009,dillon_et_al2015}
\begin{equation}
\label{optEst}
%\xhat = \left[ \A^\dagger \N^{-1} \A \right]^{-1} \A^\dagger \N^{-1} \vis,
\xhat = \mathbf{M} \A^\dagger \N^{-1} \vis,
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{M}$ is some invertible matrix chosen by the data analyst, and
$\N$ is the noise covariance matrix, defined as $\langle \mathbf{n}
\mathbf{n}^\dagger \rangle$, with angled brackets denoting an ensemble average.
Again, our vector/matrix expressions are basis-independent, so even though the
formation of $\xhat$ is often described as ``mapmaking", it need not correspond
to spatial imaging in the traditional sense of the word.

The error bars on the estimator $\xhat$ are obtained by computing the square root
of the diagonal elements of the covariance $\boldsymbol \Sigma$, which is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sigma}
\boldsymbol \Sigma \equiv \langle (\x - \xhat) ( \x - \xhat)^\dagger \rangle = \mathbf{M} \A^\dagger \N^{-1} \A\mathbf{M}^\dagger.
\end{equation}
With a suitable choice of $\mathbf{M}$, the estimator given by Equation \eqref{optEst}
minimizes the variance. Regardless of one's choice, however, Equation \eqref{optEst} 
can be shown to be lossless \citep{T97mapmaking}, in the sense that any quantities (such as power
spectra) formed further downstream in one's analysis will have identically
small error bars whether one forms these data products from $\xhat$ or chooses
to work with the larger and more cumbersome set of original data $\vis$.
%
%
%Regardless of the basis we work
%in, this estimator is unbiased, i.e.
%\begin{equation}
%\label{unbiased}
%\langle \xhat \rangle = \x,
%\end{equation}
%and has minimum variance, which is given by
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:sigma}
%\boldsymbol \Sigma \equiv \langle (\x - \xhat) ( \x - \xhat)^\dagger \rangle = \left[ \A^\dagger \N^{-1} \A \right]^{-1}.
%\end{equation}
%The estimator given by Equation \eqref{optEst} can also be proved to be
%lossless \citep{Tegmark97}, in the sense that any quantities (such as power
%spectra) formed further downstream in one's analysis will have identically
%small error bars whether one forms these data products from $\xhat$ or chooses
%to work with the larger and more cumbersome set of original data $\vis$.
%
%[XXX: add that the unbiased condition holds only when the matrix is invertible.]

In principle, Equation \eqref{optEst} is all that is needed to optimally
estimate the true sky.  One simply forms the relevant matrices and performs the
requisite matrix inversions and multiplications.  However, this is
computationally infeasible in practice, given that modern-day interferometers
are comprised of a large number of baselines operating over long integration
times, resulting in rather large matrices.  This is what motivated the authors
of \cite{Shaw2013} to propose their $m$-mode formalism, essentially rendering
many of the relevant matrices sparse, making them computationally easy to
manipulate.  While the $m$-mode formalism is a general framework that can be
used to solve a variety of problems (such as mitigating foreground
contamination), our goal here is to develop similarly convenient techniques for
the mapmaking problem (i.e., the formation of $\xhat$), with much detail
devoted to the intuition behind how our optimal estimator operates for an
interferometer.

\subsection{The general sub-optimality of time integration}
\label{timeSubOpt}

We begin by showing that it is suboptimal to make maps by integrating visibilities in time.
Writing out Equation \eqref{eq:originalVis} for the visibility $V_{b\nu}(t)$ with an explicit coordinate system, we have\begin{eqnarray}
\label{generalVis}
V_{b\nu}(t) &&= \int A_\nu(\rhat, t) I_\nu(\rhat) \exp \left[ -i 2 \pi \left( \frac{b_y}{\lambda} \cos \eta \sin \delta \right) \right] \nonumber \\
&& \times  \exp \left[ -i 2 \pi \left( \frac{b_0}{\lambda} \cos \delta \sin(\alpha - \omega_\Earth t ) \right) \right]  d\Omega +n(t), \qquad
\end{eqnarray}
where $n(t)$ is the instrumental noise, $\alpha$ and $\delta$ are the right ascension and declination, respectively, $\eta$ is the geographic latitude of the
array, and $b_0 \equiv \sqrt{b_x^2 + b_y^2 \sin^2 \eta}$, where $b_x$ and $b_y$
are the east-west and north-south baseline lengths, respectively.  We have chosen
our definition of $t=0$ to conveniently absorb an arbitrary constant phase. Like before,
 we are assuming that the primary beam is fixed with
respect to local coordinates and translates azimuthally on the celestial
sphere.  We additionally assume that the baseline is phased to zenith.  In
other words, Equation \eqref{generalVis} describes an interferometer observing
in a drift-scan mode.

To see how integrating in time may be suboptimal, consider a simplified, purely
pedagogical thought experiment where our interferometer consists of a single
east-west baseline ($b_y=0$) situated at the equator ($\eta = 0$).  For the
primary beam, suppose we have a beam that is extremely narrow in the polar
direction, so that $A_\nu(\rhat, t) \equiv \delta^{D}(\delta)
A_\nu^\alpha(\alpha-\omega_\Earth t)$, where $ \delta^{D}$ signifies a Dirac delta
function.  Plugging these into restrictions into our
equation, we obtain
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{simpVis}
V_{b\nu} (t) && = \int  \, A_\nu^\alpha(\alpha-\omega_\Earth t)  I_\nu \left( \delta = 0, \alpha \right) \nonumber \\
&&\times \exp \left[ -i 2 \pi  \frac{b_x}{\lambda} \sin(\alpha - \omega_\Earth t ) \right] d\alpha+ n(t).
\end{eqnarray}
For a single baseline, the function $V_{b\nu} (t)$ is precisely the continuous version
of the discrete data vector $\vis$. To obtain $\vis$, then, one would simply sample
$V_{b\nu} (t)$ discretely in time. For a multi-baseline array, forming $\vis$ involves following
the above procedure for each baseline, and then concatenating the resulting vectors
to form a single long $\vis$ vector. To make our analytic manipulations more convenient,
however, we will keep $t$ a continuous variable, so that $\vis$ is a hybrid quantity,
discrete in baseline but continuous in time. Acting on $\vis$ by a matrix then involves
summing over baselines and integrating over time.

Identifying $n(t)$ and $I_\nu(\theta= \pi / 2, \varphi)$ as
the continuous versions of $\mathbf{n}$ and $\x$ respectively, the rest of
Equation \eqref{simpVis}'s integrand can be interpreted as the continuous version of $\A$.  We
can model the noise covariance between baselines $b$ and $b^\prime$, at times
$t$ and $t^\prime$ as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:noiseCovar}
N_{bb^\prime} (t, t^\prime) = \sigma^2 \delta_{bb^\prime} \delta(t-t^\prime),
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is an root-mean-square noise level assumed to be uncorrelated in
time and uncorrelated between baselines.

To see how the optimal prescription of Equation \eqref{optEst} combines
information from different times, we need only evaluate $\A^\dagger \N^{-1}
\vis$, for the $\mathbf{M}$ has no time index, so its application has no impact
on how time-ordered data is combined. In our toy model, we
have
\begin{equation}
\label{toyComb}
\left( \A^\dagger \N^{-1} \vis \right)_{\alpha} \! = \! \sum_b \!\!  \int \frac{dt}{\sigma^2} \,  A_\nu^\alpha(\alpha-\omega_\Earth t) \, e^{ i 2 \pi  \frac{b_x}{\lambda} \sin(\alpha - \omega_\Earth t ) } V_{b\nu}(t),
\end{equation}
where the $\alpha$ variable serves as the continuous version of a discrete
vector index.  This expression shows that the optimal, minimum variance
prescription does not call for the integration of visibilities in time.
Instead, our expression calls for the \emph{convolution} of the visibility data
with a kernel that is specified by the primary beam shape and the baseline.

Now, recall from the convolution theorem that convolution in time is equivalent
to multiplication in the Fourier dual space of time.  For an interferometer
baseline, this Fourier dual space is fringe-rate.  Equation \eqref{toyComb}
therefore suggests that the optimal way to combine different time samples is to
express visibilities in fringe-rate space, and then to weight different
fringe-rates appropriately before summing.  We will develop this application of
fringe-rate filtering in greater generality in Section \ref{fringeRateIntro}.

%It is also important to emphasize that the technique of instantaneous
%snapshots---where one uses information from different baselines to form an
%instantaneous snapshot of the sky, which is then averaged with other snapshots
%to form a final image---is also sub-optimal.  In our notation, this would
%correspond to 

\subsection{The special case where integrating in time is optimal}

Before proceeding, it is instructive to establish the special case where time
integration is the optimal technique, since it is frequently employed in the
literature.  An inspection of Equation \eqref{toyComb} shows that were it not
for the time-dependence in the primary beam and the time-dependence of the sky
moving through a baseline's fringes, the optimal recipe would indeed reduce to
an integration of visibilities in time.  Finding the limit where time
integration is optimal is then equivalent to finding a special case where the
aforementioned time-dependences vanish.

Recall that in our previous example, the primary beam had a time-dependence
only because our thought-experiment consisted of a drift-scan telescope, whose
measurement equation was written in coordinates fixed to the celestial sphere.
Instead of this, suppose one had a narrow primary beam that tracked a small
patch of the sky.  The primary beam would then have a fixed shape in celestial
coordinates, and $A_\nu(\rhat, t)$ would simply become $A_\nu(\rhat)$ in Equation
\eqref{generalVis}.  To attempt to nullify the time-dependence of fringes
sweeping across the celestial sphere, one may phase the visibilities in a
time-dependent way, essentially tracking the center of the patch as it moves
across the sky.  Putting this all together and assuming that the primary beam
is narrow enough to justify a flat-sky approximation, the measurement equation
becomes
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{flatSkyVis}
V_{b\nu}(t) &&= \int A_\nu(\rhat) I_\nu(\rhat) \exp \left[ -i 2 \pi \left( \frac{b_0}{\lambda}  \sin(\alpha - \omega_\Earth t )\right) \right] \nonumber\\
&&\!\!\! \times \exp \left[-i 2 \pi \left( \frac{b_y}{\lambda} \cos \eta \cos \delta \right) + i \psi(t) \right] d\Omega +n(t), \qquad
\end{eqnarray}
[XXX: check this equation]
where we have assumed for simplicity that the center of our small field is
directly above the equator, and that a time-dependent phase $\psi(t)$ has been
applied.  With this, the optimal combination of time-ordered data becomes
\begin{eqnarray}
\left( \A^\dagger \N^{-1} \vis \right)_{(\delta,\alpha)}^\textrm{flat} &&  = \frac{A_\nu(\delta,\alpha)}{\sigma^2} e^{i 2 \pi \frac{b_y}{\lambda} \cos \eta \cos \delta}  \nonumber  \\
&&\!\!\! \times \sum_b \int  dt \,\,e^{ i 2 \pi  \frac{b_x}{\lambda} \sin(\alpha - \omega_\Earth t ) -i \psi (t) } V_{b\nu}(t). \qquad
\end{eqnarray}
This is still not quite a simple average in time because there is no choice of
$\psi(t)$ that can cancel out the time-dependence of $\sin (\alpha -
\omega_\Earth t)$ for all $\varphi$ and all $t$.  Another way to phrase the
problem is to note that even in the flat-sky approximation, one cannot expand
Taylor expand $\sin (\alpha - \omega_\Earth t)$ over long observation times.
With short observations, however, an expansion is justified, and picking
$\psi(t) = 2 \pi \frac{b_x}{\lambda} \omega_\Earth t$ gives
\begin{eqnarray}
\left( \A^\dagger \N^{-1} \vis \right)_{(\delta,\alpha)}^\textrm{flat,short} =  &&\frac{A_\nu(\delta,\alpha)}{\sigma^2} e^{i 2 \pi \left( \frac{b_y}{\lambda} \cos \eta \cos \delta + \frac{b_x}{\lambda} \sin\alpha \right)} \nonumber \\
&& \times \sum_b   \int  dt \, V_{b\nu}(t),
\end{eqnarray}
which is a simple averaging in time.  In short, then, integrating in time is an
optimal way to combine time-ordered data only if a number of criteria are met:
the flat-sky approximation must hold, the primary beam must track the field,
the visibilities must be phased to track the center of the field, and the
observations must be short.
[XXX: maybe say that we're essentially clarifying the conditions necessary for fringe-stopping to work]
\subsection{Optimized fringe-rate filtering for imaging}
\label{fringeRateIntro}

We now proceed to derive the optimal prescription for combining time-ordered
data, which will naturally give rise to fringe-rate filtering.  Because we will
\emph{not} be invoking the same approximations as we did in previous sections,
we will begin with Equation \eqref{generalVis}.  From
our toy example (Equation \ref{toyComb}), we know that fringe-rate space (the
Fourier dual of time) is a promising space in which to combine time-ordered
data.  Here, we make the assumption that we are dealing with a full sidereal
day's worth of data, so that the visibility in fringe-rate space is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:FringeTransformDef}
\overline{V}_{b\nu} (f) \equiv \frac{1}{T_\Earth} \int_{-T_\Earth / 2}^{T_\Earth /2} dt \exp \left( - 2 \pi i f t \right) V_{b\nu} (t),
\end{equation}
where $f$ is the fringe-rate, and $T_\Earth = 2 \pi / \omega_\Earth$ is the
Earth's rotation period. It is natural to work in fringe-rate bins such that
the $n$th bin is given by $f_n \equiv n / T_\Earth$, where $n$ is an
integer.  The measurement in the $n$th bin is then given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{fringeVis}
\overline{V}_{b\nu} (f_n) &&= \int d\Omega \, T(\rhat) e^{-i 2 \pi  \frac{b_y}{\lambda} \cos \eta \sin \delta} \nonumber \\
&& \!\!\!\times  \int_{-\frac{T_\Earth}{ 2}}^{\frac{T_\Earth}{2}} \frac{dt}{T_\Earth} \, B(\rhat, t) e^{ -i  \frac{2 \pi n t}{T_\Earth} +i  \frac{2\pi b_0}{\lambda} \cos \delta \sin \left( \omega_\Earth t - \alpha \right)}, \qquad
\end{eqnarray}
where we have temporarily omitted the additive noise term to avoid mathematical
clutter.  To proceed, we make some simplifying assumptions (although only some
of which are absolutely required).  First, assume that we are once again
considering a drift-scan instrument.  If the primary beam shape is
approximately separable, we can then say
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SepBeam}
B(\rhat, t) \equiv B_\delta (\delta) B_\alpha (\alpha - \omega_\Earth t),
\end{equation}
where $B_\alpha$ is a function with period $2\pi$.  Taking advantage of this periodicity, we can write the beam as
\begin{equation}
B(\rhat, t) = B_\delta (\delta) \sum_q \overline{B}_q e^{-iq \alpha} e^{i q \omega_\Earth t},
\end{equation}
where $\overline{B}_q \equiv \int \frac{d\alpha}{2\pi} B_\alpha(\alpha)
e^{i q\alpha}$ is the $q^{th}$ Fourier coefficient.  Plugging this into
Equation \eqref{fringeVis} and making the substitution $\psi \equiv
\omega_\Earth t - \varphi$, one obtains
\begin{eqnarray}
\overline{V}_{b\nu} && (f_n)= \int d\Omega \, T(\rhat) B_\delta (\delta) e^{-i 2 \pi  \frac{b_y}{\lambda} \cos \eta \sin \delta} \nonumber \\
&& \times \sum_q \frac{\overline{B}_q e^{-i n \varphi}}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi -\varphi}^{\pi+\varphi} d\psi \, e^{i (q-n) \psi +i \frac{2 \pi b_0}{\lambda} \cos \delta \sin \psi}. \qquad
\end{eqnarray}
Now, note that the integral over $\psi$ is of a periodic function over one
period.  We may therefore freely shift the limits of the integral by a constant
amount without affecting the result.  In particular, we may remove the
$+\varphi$ terms in the limits (the only restriction being that having performed a $\varphi$-dependent shift, it is no longer legal to permute the various integrals), and
the result is a standard integral form for a Bessel function $J$ of the first
kind:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{fringeBessel}
\overline{V}_{b\nu} (f_n) =&& \int \frac{d\Omega}{2 \pi}\, T(\rhat) B_\delta (\delta) e^{-i 2 \pi  \frac{b_y}{\lambda} \cos \eta \sin \delta}
e^{-i n \alpha} \nonumber \\ 
&& \times \sum_q \overline{B}_q  J_{n-q} \left( \frac{2 \pi b_0}{\lambda} \cos \delta \right).
\end{eqnarray}
Several features are of note here.  For wide primary beams, $\overline{B}_q$
is sharply peaked around $q=0$, so the terms following the sum over $q$
essentially amount to $J_n ( 2 \pi b_0 \cos \delta / \lambda )$.  Now, notice
that the argument of the Bessel function is bounded, always lying between $\pm
2\pi b_0/ \lambda$.  For large $n$ (high fringe-rate bins), then, one can use
the small argument asymptotic form for $J_n$,\begin{equation}
J_n \left( \frac{2 \pi b_0 \cos \delta}{ \lambda} \right) \approx \frac{1}{n!} \left( \frac{ \pi b_0 \cos \delta}{ \lambda} \right)^n,
\end{equation}
which is a sharply decreasing function of $n$ for large $n$.  This means that
there must be very little sky signal at high fringe-rate bins, which is yet another
reflection of the salient feature that we have emphasized throughout this paper:
high fringe-rate bins constitute noise-dominated modes, since the Earth's rotation
rate works in conjunction with the baseline length to impose a maximum fringe-rate
for sources locked to the celestial sphere.

Putting together the optimal prescription as we did above, we have
%
%With celestial emission appearing only in low fringe-rate bins, it is
%reasonable to expect that one can reduce noise (in other words, achieving the
%goals of time integration) by Fourier transforming the data into fringe-rate
%space and downweighting (or discarding) high fringe-rate modes.  This is
%confirmed by constructing the optimal prescription as we did above, which
%yields
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:AdagNinvv}
\left( \A^\dagger \N^{-1} \vis \right)_{\delta,\alpha} && = \frac{B_\delta^* (\delta)  \cos \delta}{2\pi \sigma^2} \sum_{b,n} e^{i n \alpha} e^{i 2 \pi  \frac{b_y}{\lambda} \cos \eta \sin \delta} \nonumber \\
&& \times \sum_{q} \widetilde{B}_q^* J_{n-q} \left( \frac{2 \pi b_0}{\lambda} \cos \delta \right) \overline{V}_{b\nu} (f_n). \qquad
\end{eqnarray}
In words, this recipe instructs us to move into fringe-rate space (where the
sky emission is already concentrated in $f_n$) and to further downweight by
$\sum_{q} \widetilde{B}_q^* J_{n-q} \left( \frac{2 \pi b_0}{\lambda} \cos \delta \right)$, which, as we have argued above, is small for high fringe
rates.  Thus, low-pass fringe-rate filtering is the optimal way to combine
time-ordered data from an interferometer.

In summary, we see that low-pass fringe-rate filtering once again appears as an integral part of an optimal
recipe, this time for mapmaking. While we made some assumptions (such as a separable beam) for analytic
convenience, our qualitative conclusions are general. To generalize our treatment, one can simply return
to Equation \eqref{fringeVis}, numerically evaluating the integral over time. One can then read off an expression
for $\mathbf{A}$ from the remaining integral, and proceed as before.
%
%
%Before proceeding, let us summarize the essential features of fringe-rate filtering, away from the approximation of a separable beam in Equation \eqref{eq:SepBeam}. Returning to Equations \eqref{eq:FringeTransformDef} and \eqref{fringeVis}, we see that because the sky $T(\hat{\mathbf{r}})$ is not a function of time, the Fourier transform into fringe-rate space acts only on the beam and the fringe pattern. We can therefore write
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:CompactNotation}
%\overline{V}_b (f_n) = \int d\Omega \,T(\hat{\mathbf{r}}) g_{bn} (\hat{\mathbf{r}}) 
%%\approx \frac{4 \pi}{N}  \sum_i T(\hat{\mathbf{r}}_i) g_{bn} (\hat{\mathbf{r}}_i)
%,
%\end{equation}
%where the key quantity is
%\begin{eqnarray}
%g_{bn} (\hat{\mathbf{r}})  &&\equiv e^{-i 2 \pi  \frac{b_y}{\lambda} \cos \eta \sin \delta} \nonumber \\
% &&\times \int_{-\frac{T_\Earth}{ 2}}^{\frac{T_\Earth}{2}} \frac{dt}{T_\Earth} \, B(\rhat, t) e^{ -i  \frac{2 \pi n t}{T_\Earth} +i  \frac{2\pi b_0}{\lambda} \cos \delta \sin \left( \omega_\Earth t - \alpha \right)}. \qquad
%\end{eqnarray}
%The term in front of the integral corresponds to the fringes in the declination direction. These are static as the Earth rotates, and therefore are unaffected by the Fourier transform. The second half of the exponent within the integral corresponds to fringes in the azimuthal direction, with the $\cos \delta$ term arising because of the spherical geometry shown in Figure \ref{fig:ew_fringe}, where sources near the equator traverse fringes more quickly than those near the pole. Examining the integral, we see that there are two contributions to a non-zero fringe-rate. First, the primary beam sweeps across the celestial sphere, crossing fringes. In addition, the changing orientation of baselines relative to the celestial sphere induces a fringe-rate. Over a short time-integration (which is likely a more realistic scenario than integrating over $T_\Earth$ as we have assumed so far) we may approximate this second contribution by Taylor expanding the $\sin(\omega_\Earth t - \alpha)$ term. This yields a time-dependence that may be absorbed into the $\exp \left(-i 2 \pi n t / T_\Earth \right)$ term as an additive term to the fringe-rate bin $n$. What remains is then simply a phase-shifted Fourier transform of the primary beam. In other words, $g_{bn} (\hat{\mathbf{r}})$ selects portions of the primary beam where sources on the sky have a fringe-rate of $n/ T_\Earth$. Now, since
%$\overline{V}_b (f_n)  = \int d\Omega  \,T (\hat{\mathbf{r}}) g_{bn} (\hat{\mathbf{r}})$, each row of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ corresponds to $g_{bn} (\hat{\mathbf{r}})$ for a different baseline $b$ and/or fringe rate bin $n$, and our optimal prescription for combining time-ordered data becomes
%\begin{equation}
%\left( \A^\dagger \N^{-1} \vis \right)_{\delta,\alpha} \propto \sum_{n,b} g_{bn}^* (\hat{\mathbf{r}}) \overline{V}_b (f_n).
%\end{equation}
%One sees that the procedure essentially calls for a weighting that emphasizes the fringe rate bins that fall on bright portions of the primary beam. As seen in our toy example, this preferentially favors lower fringe-rates over higher ones.
%

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have revisited the concept of filtering the visibility time-series
measured by an interferometric baseline that was presented in \citet{parsons_backer2009}.
Using a mapping between the timescale of variation in visibility data and position
on the sky for a chosen baseline, we show that the rectangular time windows typically
used when integrating visibilities are almost always sub-optimal, and motivate 
filtering on the basis of fringe rate
as step for optimally combining time-ordered visibility data.  In Section \ref{sec:Mapmaking}, we show 
that fringe-rate filtering naturally arises as part of optimized mapmaking prescriptions such as those
described in \citet{T97mapmaking}, \citet{morales_matejek2009}, or \citet{dillon_et_al2015}.

We also show that fringe-rate filtering can alternately be interpreted as a per-baseline
operation for sculpting the primary beam along the declination direction [XXX: it doesn't have to be
just declination?].  Using analytic
derivations and simulations, we highlight several important applications of such beam
sculpting.  One key application for 21cm cosmological experiments starved for sensitivity
is the ability to re-weight visibility data according to the SNR in each fringe-rate bin.
As shown in Section \ref{sec:PspecOptimization}, pre-processing the visibilities in such a way
allows an optimal (minimum variance) estimate of the power spectrum to be formed by
squaring visibilities time-slice-by-time-slice before averaging the results together. This
somewhat surprising result allows a data analyst to deal directly with visibilities until
the final squaring step, allowing for cleaner diagnoses of instrumental systematics while
avoid many analysis-induced systematics associated with gridding data on the $uv$ plane.
%
%This operation, which is effectively a one-dimensional case of the optimal beam
%weighting described in \citet{morales_matejek2009} and \citet{bhatnagar_et_al2008}, 
%can improve the sensitivity achieved in a per-baseline power spectral analysis by a factor
%of several % XXX check
%while avoiding many of the systematics associated with gridding data in the $uv$ plane.
%Crucially, this 
Other important application include improving the match between polarization beam to
reduce polarization leakage, and down-weighting areas low in the primary beam
to reduce systematics from off-axis foregrounds.

In \citet{ali_et_al2015}, the fringe-rate filtering techniques presented here are applied to
observations from the PAPER array as part of their power-spectrum analysis pipeline.  The
results highlight the power of fringe-rate filtering in 21cm cosmology applications.
Given its efficiency, flexibility, and close alignment with the natural observing
basis of radio interferometers, we anticipate that fringe-rate filtering is likely to be
an important analysis tool for current 21cm experiments, as well as future instruments
such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA; \citealt{pober_et_al2014}) and
the Square Kilometre Array (SKA; \citealt{XXX}).
