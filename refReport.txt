Referee Report 

Dear editor, authors,

I have reviewed the paper "optimized beam sculpting with generalized fringe-rate filters". It is well written and describes relevant new techniques which have already been shown to be beneficial in power-spectrum analysis of radio data. The paper is potentially very useful, but I do have quite a few comments which I believe should be fixed before publication.

On page 4, in the description of the FIR filter: A crucial detail for fringe-rate filtering is the requirement to both have a broad window function (function gamma) for most effective filtering and to prevent mode mixing, while simultaneously desiring a small window to satisfy the linear time-dependence assumption (for Eq 3), which is also desirable for other practical issues like calibration and RFI mitigation. While these assumptions are mostly mentioned during the derivations, the effect of the window size is not discussed, but has some implications. 

One trivial implication is visible in Fig. 3, which shows a time kernel which is over 2 hours in time. Since in Ali et al. 2015 night-time observations of 8.30 hour were used, at face value it seems that in such a case almost 25% of the data had to be discarded to properly filter the data. How is this handled? Moreover, could the authors describe what kind of windowing function is used, and how its size was chosen?

ARP Although 8.3 hrs of data were used in the final analysis, this time range
was selected after the application of a fringe-rate filter to a longer (~12 hr)
data set.  Hence, the 8.3 hr window was not limited by the boundary conditions
to which the reviewer is referring.  The windowing function was chosen to be a
XXX, with width chosen to truncate the time-domain kernel in regions where the
weighting falls below XXX % of the peak response.  This windowing has a minor
effect of the shape of the effective fringe-domain response.  This deviation
from optimal weighting has only a negligible effect on sensitivity, and is
balanced by the other merits of having a compact time-domain kernel.

Some quantitative results are presented on Page 8 and 12. On Page 8 this is the signal loss assuming a Gaussian random field and the point-source gain of the sculpted beam. Page 12 describes the sensitivity improvement of the filtering, which is convincing. However, none of these tests quantify how much signal is mixed from one mode to another because of the finite filter size. This could e.g. be visualized by simulating a non-uniform (e.g. single mode) power spectrum and measuring the reconstructed power spectrum. Since this method is quite crucial for the EoR analyses, I think this effect should be extensively & quantitatively validated.

ARP, ACL DISCUSSION NEEDED.  The reviewer is correct that fringe-rate filtering
creates correlations between what would otherwise be independent modes sampled
as a function of time.  The number of independent modes preserved for power
spectrum analysis corresponds directly to the number and weighting of
fringe-rate modes by the fringe-rate filter.  Even for short time-domain
integrations, quantifying the number of sampled modes is very tricky, as the
time dependence of a baselines projection (and hence, uv mode sampling) toward
a patch of sky varies substantially over the wide fields of view of
low-frequency interferometers such as PAPER and the MWA.  Indeed, optimal
fringe-rate filtering addresses this spatially varying time dependence more
directly than standard square time-domain integrations might.  This trickiness
is addressed in Parsons et al. (2014), where we determine that to accurately
determine the statistical interdependence of these modes in either the
fringe-rate filtering or square time-domain integration case, it is necessary
to use bootstrapping.  We will echo that finding here.

Related to this, on Page 8, col 1, 11th line before bottom the authors write: "These compare well to the results shown in Figure 7." This is arguable; Fig 6 is clearly different from Fig. 7. The technique significantly enhances the sensitivity of the power spectrum, as shown later, but by itself having a beam which acts like Fig. 6 looks actually worrying. This needs to be elaborated and should be quantified.

ARP, ACL DISCUSSION NEEDED. Two separate points here. First, whether figures 6
and 7 look similar.  I really do think they do. Maybe emphasize that this
really is just finite resolution effects, and that there's convergence as we
increase the number of slices through the beam? Second point is why the beam in
Figure 6 is worrying? Maybe because of all the features? Perhaps we should
emphasize that the "actual" effect of the instrument + filtering is given by
Figure 7, not the noisy version in Figure 6. Ultimately, all we really need are
the various versions of the beam area, and we can use the analytic expression
(i.e. use Figure 7) if we want.

My final issue is that the paper is a bit long for what it presents. Parts that were in particular somewhat distracting from the main points of the paper were the discussion of the normalization of the power spectrum estimator (Page 7 last paragraph, and 8 up to the paragraph ending with "...with the effective primary beam.") and the discussion showing that optimal map making would filter high fringe rates (Page 16, under Eq 59), which of course is not surprising, as well as that common uv-gridding employed for map making also includes a low-pass filter, which is similar to fringe-rate filtering. Hence, I suggest removing both parts, possibly putting the PS normalization into an Appendix if the authors feel it is relevant, and I recommend further reduction of size if possible.

ACL DISCUSSION NEEDED. Probably happy to move normalization to appendix.
Mapmaking connection, maybe not.

I have some further smaller issues which I detail below:

Page 1, col 1, first paragraph:
"These differences ... interferometers that only have moderate angular resolution...", and later LOFAR is mentioned as one such interferometer. This should be reworded a bit, since I would not say that LOFAR has 'moderate' angular resolution, better to say 'with less focus' or something similar.

DONE. Changed "that broadly fit this description" to "that broadly fit some or
all of this description"

Page 1, col 2, par 2:
"In this paper, we extend ideas..."
Probably the paper by D. Roshi and R. Perley ("A New Technique to improve RFI suppression in Radio Interferometers", 2003, http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0304493 ) is quite relevant as well.

XXX?

Page 2, col 1, par 1:
"...providing cleaner views of systematics in the data"
"Cleaner" is somewhat subjective -- they can be helpful for some systematics, but can actually hide others. I would thus rather say "a different view"

DONE

Fig 1:
It seems the arrows do not scale properly compared to the lines of longitude. Caption: delta not defined.

DONE

Eq. 2: (and all Eq following)
It might be useful to change f(t'-t) in (t'-t)f, as the first looks like a function evaluation.

DONE

4th line below Eq. 2:
"...our transform at time t'=t."
The window function here is centred here, not the transform. Also, it is centred on t, not on t'=t."

DONE. "thereby centering our transform at time $t^\prime = t$" -> "in essence
shifting the origin of our transform to time $t$"

Next line:
"...the time-dependence of the visibility will likely be...through the celestial sphere."
The filter size does not influence the time-dependence of the visibilities. Reword. Also see my comments on the window size at this point.

DONE. "If the characteristic width of $\gamma$ is relatively short, one is
effectively examining the visibility over short timescales, during which its
time-dependence will likely be dominated by features on the sky moving relative
to fringes, and not the movement of the primary beam through the celestial
sphere."

Below Eq. 3; worth mentioning explicitly that this assumes a relatively small window size.

DISAGREE. The discussion before Equation 3 is explicitly about short time
periods/small window sizes, and it's probably overkill to mention the
approximation both before and after.

Eq. 4: It took me some time figuring out why the term "nu/c(b_t x omega)r" is negative; the authors might help the reader by already reversing the omega x b term in Eq. 3. The 'x' meaning 'multiply' on the beginning of the 2nd line is somewhat confusing with cross product or convolution. Below Eq 4: as it is written, gamma-tilde is the *inverse* FT of gamma.

DONE.

Page 3, col 2, first word: "as advertised", somewhat awkward word for a paper.

DONE. "as advertised" -> "as claimed"

Page 3, col 2, line 3: "shows contours". There are no contours drawn...

DONE. "contours" -> "shaded bands"

Page 4, line 1: "that essentially averages together data." I wouldn't say filtering is essentially averaging, they're different operations. The authors could say something like that it reduces entropy of the data making it better compressible, if that is what the authors are trying to say.

DONE. Elaborating a little bit: "For example, if $w(f)$ is chosen in a way that
suppresses high fringe rates, the effect in the time domain will be a low-pass
filter that (among other features) has the rough effect of averaging together
data."

Page 4, col 1, par 2, line 3: "be used in for" bad sentence.

DONE. "be used in for" -> "be used for"

Sect 3, line 5: "its origins targeting" awkward sentence.

DONE. "In keeping with its origins targeting observations from the PAPER array"
-> "keeping with its origins as a tool for analyzing data from the PAPER array"

Figure 3. Can the authors explain why the XX/YY matching line has such a different shape, and is cut off at ~-0.7? (possibly on P 12 where it is discussed) I assume this implies that the fringe response shown is only for XX or YY? Please specify. Is the high frequency in this fringe-rate filter also a reason for the insufficient beam correction in Fig. 8, or is it just the 1D nature of the fringe filter which causes this?

ARP XX/YY only aims to normalize the YY beam to the XX beam.  This ratio does
not include the absolute beam response (which the other curves include as
optimal weighting), and so the curve has a substantially different shape.
Fringe is only XX.  Cut at -0.7 is just an effect of the vertical scale, chosen
to keep the other curves legible.  Since the XX/YY ratio can diverge as YY goes
toward zero, and because the blue solid curve includes similar information but
in a beam-weighted fashion, this cropping was deemed acceptable.  The "high
frequency", which we interpret to mean the variation of this function with
fringe rate, is not a limiting factor in the beam matching; it is, as the
reviewer speculates, just the 1D nature of the fringe filter.

Page 5, col 2, line 8: "primary beam A_i(r)" and three lines later:
I think it is more logical to write A_i(r, nu).

DISAGREE for notational compactness

5 lines under Eq 8: "it is implicitly assumed that the baseline length is given by b=u lambda", I don't understand why defined this way, why not 'explicitly' say "and u = b/lambda..." ?

DONE.

Footnote 6; I could not find this (easily) in Liu et al. (2014b), could the authors specify a location in the paper for this approximation?

DONE. Section III A. Kinda buried.

Page 5, col 2, 9th line to last: "as an integral over angles" -> solid angle

DONE

Page 6, line under Eq 14: "where nu21 := 1420", use approx symbol.

DONE.

Page 7, before Eq. 24: might clarify this is combining (17), (22) and (23).

DONE.

Page 7, col 1, under Eq 26: "This is a rather remarkable result, ..." -- I'm not sure why the authors find this remarkable... Indeed, it can be described as somewhat 'counter-intuitive' when thinking about 'normal' visibility averaging.

DISAGREE. "Remarkable" in the sense of "worthy of a remark because it is
counterintuitive", and in the next sentence we say that it's counterintuitive.

Page 8, col 1, par 2, line 3: "derviations" -> derivations.

DONE.

Page 8, col 1, 7th line before bottom: "As these simulations illustrate...point-source simulations". I do not understand this sentence, clarify. Are the authors saying the difference between Fig 6 and 7 can be explained by the 'binning'? Isn't the binning equal in both Fig 6 and 7?

ARP Binning is not equal.  Fig. 7 is an analytic beam that is interpolated to
high precision.  In Fig. 6, this same level of resolution is not available
because the beam is reconstructed from source tracks that are simulated for
every 5 degrees in declination.  To smooth over the beam on scales of 5
degrees, coarser binning is used.

Page 9, col 2, par 2, "The typical technique for..." Typical for dishes, but I don't think this is 'typical' for aperture arrays with a fixed element beam, which involve more typically a multiplication of an inverse Mueller matrix (e.g. as is done in AW-projection for LOFAR by Tasse et al., 2012, http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.6178, or for the MWA as done in the RTS as in Mitchel et al. 2008 http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.1912 and Offringa et al. 2014 http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1943 ).

DONE. "The typical technique for..." -> "A commonly used technique..."

Page 9, col 2, par 3, line 10-13: "As such, for a chosen uv coordinate, ... before summing." I am not sure what the authors mean here: convolving the XX and YY visibilities in uv-space (in 2d) with the Fourier transform of the full inverse Mueller matrix image would completely correct that particular mode for the beam, resulting in zero leakage on average. This does not depend on overlap of kernels with other visibilities. Clarify or remove.

Add footnote w/ ref response + explanation below
ARP DISCUSSION: In image domain, the baseline fringe pattern has been
integrated across the sky weighted by two different (XX, YY) beams.  This means
that an interferometric baseline for these two polarizations samples the uv
plane convolved by two different kernels --- the Fourier transforms of the XX,
YY beams, respectively.  Because the resulting V_XX, V_YY visibilities no
longer retain any direction-dependent information (they were integrated over
angle) V_XX and V_YY cannot be re-weighted in a way that produces pure Stokes I
response in all directions, except in the trivial case that the YY beam differs
from the XX beam by a direction-independent multiplicative factor.  Said
another way, given a single degree of freedom in the relative weighting of V_XX
and V_YY, it is not possible to gaurantee a pure Stokes I response in more than
one direction.

It is common practice in synthesis imaging to grid visibilities in the uv plane
with convolving kernels that contain direction-dependent information.  Examples
include W-projection kernels, the Fourier transform of the primary beam used in
optimal map making, and (relevant here) the Fourier transform of the inverse of
direction-dependent Mueller matrices.  Indeed, in the case of a completely
sampled uv plane, the inverse Mueller beam kernel would perfectly match the XX
and YY beams.  However, as the sampling of the uv plane becomes sparser, the
removal of samples removes degrees of freedom in weighting as a function of
direction.  In the limiting case of a very sparse array where the convolving
kernels of uv samples do not overlap, we revert to the single
direction-independent weighting factor above.

Another way of thinking about this is to realize that, by gridding visibilities
in the uv plane with a convolving kernel, we are attempting to reassign sky
intensity from the visibility, which was integrated over in equation 1, back to
its original location so that it may be re-weighted to match the XX and YY
polarization responses.  This inversion is only well posed in the case of a
completely sampled uv plane.  As we lose uv samples, we lose the ability to
reconstruct the original sky intensity, and hence, to perfectly match the XX
and YY polarization responses as a function of direction.  In the case of a
sparsely sampled uv plane, it is only possible to construct a pure Stokes I
response as a function of direction if one has sufficient additional
information about the sky (for example, if it sparsely populated by point
sources) that one can reconstruct the missing modes and hence, fully invert the
uv plane.

Page 9, col 2, par 4, line 11-..: "Typically, earth-rotation synthesis.." somewhat same comment as above; I don't know what the authors mean, but arrays like MWA and LOFAR can perform adequate beam correction of snapshots, so this statement seems not correct.

ARP As per above, this conflates the correction of the primary beam in the
direction of particular point sources and the inversion of diffuse structure
seen through a polarized beam.

Fig 8. caption: "XX-YY/2" -> "(XX-YY)/2"

DONE

Page 11, col 1, line 8: "In the case of... products" this is dependent on the above points, and thus needs to be changed too if above points can't be clarified.

ARP Hopefully, addressed above.

Table 1: what is meant with "Effective integration time" ? (in particular how the last number can be 5570 with less sensitivity)

ARP, ACL DISCUSSION NEEDED. Probably should define exactly which "width" of the
filter is used to define t_eff.  For 2nd question, because if we integrate for
too long we completely wipe out the beam area.

Page 14, last line of par 1: "...the most natural". 
It is mentioned quite often in the paper that the fringe domain is 'the (most) natural domain'. One could equally argue that the uv plane or some kind of weighted image domain is a natural domain for averaging. I don't object to "a natural domain", but "the most natural" seems subjective. Also, it is mentioned a bit too often.

DONE. (But really only just that one instance)

Eq. 45: define adjoint operator.

DONE

Eq. 49: the deltas here should be called delta^D to distinguish them from declination.

DONE, but only for the second copy, since the first is a Kronecker delta.

Eq. 50: Why is sigma within the integral and summation?

DISAGREE. To save space.

Under Eq. 52: "This is still not...and all t." While this is true, the non-optimality this causes for telescopes with a small tracking beam (~a few deg) is negligible. In particular, in 3rd line under Eq. 53: "...is an optimal way..only if"; the above proof shows that it is an optimal way 'if', and not 'only if', so remove 'only'. Also, it would be helpful to mention that a small beam is sufficient too.

ACL DISCUSSION NEEDED. Remove "only", "flat sky" -> achieved through a small primary beam

Sect 5.3 (as well as the abstract): I think it should be stressed that these derivations are much more applicable to drift-scan observations (or with a highly varying beam, if you wish). In tracking observations, the improvement that can be made with such weighting is insignificant. This comment also applies to Sec 6, line 7: "...are almost always sub-optimal..." ; I think that should specify 'for drift-scan observations'. Moreover, these weightings could also be applied by the a-projection technique, which would actually be more accurate, because it can weight(/correct) in two dimensions, so the authors should make some remark about a-projection.

ACL DISCUSSION NEEDED.  Add mention of a-projection.

Page 17, col 2, line 9, "..while avoid [should be avoiding] many...". Same comment to 'cleaner analysis' as before -> 'different analysis'. Also, I think that 'analysis-induced systematics associated with gridding' is too strong. It is true to say that it is beneficial to avoid gridding, but not that gridding induces many systematics. Radio astronomers know well how to grid, and dominating systematics come from other things.

DISAGREE, SORT OF. "many" -> "potential"

Page 17, col 2, final sentence: "we anticipate that fringe-filtering is likely ... [important for] ... the SKA". Currently, fringe filtering does not seem applicable to the current SKA low configuration, and the planned technique seems to be a-projection (e.g. Cornwell 2012). So, it is currently not likely that fringe filtering will be used for the SKA.

DONE. "likely be an important analysis tool" -> "may be an important analysis tool"
